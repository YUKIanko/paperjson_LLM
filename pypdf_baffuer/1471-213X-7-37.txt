Abstract
Background: In the mouse, the parenchyma of both th e liver and ventral pancreas is specified
from adjacent domains of the ventral foregut endo derm. GATA4, a zinc finger transcription factor,
is strongly expressed in these endodermal domains and molecular analyses have implicated GATA4
in potentiating liver gene expres sion during the onset of hepatogenesis. We therefore hypothesized
that GATA4 has an integral role in controlling th e early stages of pancreatic and liver development.
Results: To determine whether GATA4 contributes to  development of either the pancreas or
liver we characterized the format ion of pancreatic and hepatic tissues in embryos derived from
Gata4-/- ES cells by tetraploid embryo  complementation. In the absence of GATA4, development of
the liver and ventral pancreas was disrupted. At  embryonic day (E) 9.5, the liver bud failed to
expand although, contrary to expectations, the hepatic endoderm was able to form a pseudo-
stratified epithelial liver bud th at expressed hepatic genes. Moreov er, as we had shown previously,
the embryos lacked septum transversum mesenchyme  suggesting that liver de fects may be cell non-
autonomous. Analyses of pancreat ic development revealed a comp lete absence of the ventral but
not the dorsal pancreas in Gata4-/- embryos. Moreover, Gata6-/- embryos displayed a similar,
although less dramatic phenotype, suggesting a cr itical role for multiple GATA factors at the
earliest stages of ventral pancreas development.
Conclusion: This study defines integral roles for GATA  factors in controlli ng early development
of the mammalian liver and pancreas.
Background
In the mouse, the ventral foregut endoderm differentiates
to form the parenchymal components of the liver and
ventral pancreas. This process begins at approximately
embryonic day (E) 8.0 with the ventral foregut positioned
such that a portion of it lies immediately adjacent to the
cardiac mesoderm with the most ventral region distal
from the heart [1,2]. Growth factor signalling from thecardiac mesoderm and septum transversum mesenchyme
specifies the underlying endoderm to adopt a hepatic fate
such that by the 6–7 somite stage hepatic gene expression
can be detected in the ventral foregut endoderm [3-5].
Concurrent with these events, the most distal region of the
foregut endoderm starts to express pancreatic genes [1].

positions the newly specified hepatic and ventral pancre-
atic endoderm in close apposition to inductive mesen-
chyme that subsequently drives the proliferation and
expansion of these organs from approximately E9.0
(reviewed in [7,8]).
Molecular and genetic analyses have identified several
transcription factors central to these processes including
forkhead box proteins A1 and A2 (FOXA1 and FOXA2),
the homeodomain transcription factors HEX and PROX1,
and the PTF1a subunit of the PTF1 transcription factor
(reviewed in [7-9]). Careful analysis of transcription fac-
tor function in the foregut endoderm has, in turn, helped
define the fundamental contributions that cell prolifera-
tion and transient tissue interactions make to both hepatic
and pancreatic development (for reviews see [10-12]).
The GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors have
also been shown to be involved in the differentiation of
the endoderm in several evolutionarily diverse organisms
[13-15]. In the mouse, GATA4, 5 and 6 are expressed in
the definitive endoderm and its derivatives, and are
required to modulate endodermal gene expression [16-
21]. Moreover, we have demonstrated previously that
hepatic development is blocked at the primary liver bud
stage in embryos derived from Gata6-/- ES cells by tetra-
ploid complementation [22]. In these embryos, low levels
of hepatic mRNAs were detected in the foregut endoderm
at the 6–7 somite stage suggesting that Gata6 is not essen-
tial for hepatic specification. However, the hepatic endo-
derm subsequently failed to expand and commit to a
normal liver developmental program [22].
GATA4 was the first GATA factor to be implicated in devel-
opment of the ventral foregut. In vivo footprinting analy-
ses revealed that GATA4 occupied the hepatic Albumin
(Alb1) enhancer in ventral foregut endoderm prior to the
onset of hepatic gene expression [23]. The ability of
GATA4, in conjunction with FOXA2, to reposition nucle-
osomes around this enhancer has lead to the hypothesis
that GATA4 potentiates hepatic gene expression. In this
model, GATA4 acts with FoxA to ensure that hepatic tran-
scriptional regulatory elements are structurally capable of
interacting with liver-expressed transcriptional activators
whose own expression could be induced by paracrine sig-
nals from surrounding tissues [23-25]. From a develop-
mental perspective, GATA4 would act as a 'pioneer'
transcription factor that, along with FOXA, would help
define the competency of the endoderm to adopt a
hepatic fate.
Further support for GATA4 contributing to hepatic and
pancreatic development also comes from studies in
zebrafish [26]. In these studies, morpholino-mediateddepletion of zfGATA4 resulted in defective development
of multiple organs including the liver and pancreas. With
regard to development of the liver, depletion of either
zfGATA4 or zfGATA6 resulted in a failure of the liver line-
age to expand although hepatic specification was intact.
However, when both zfGATA4 and zfGATA6 were simul-
taneously depleted there was no indication that the liver
had initiated development, suggesting that in zebrafish
zfGATA4 and zfGATA6 had redundant roles during the
onset of hepatic development but had independent roles
during organogenesis of the liver.
The phenotype observed in zebrafish depleted of
zfGATA6 closely resembles that described for mouse
embryos generated from Gata6-/- ES cells, implying that
the role for GATA6 is evolutionarily conserved between
fish and mammals [22,26]. However, there has been
debate over whether zfGATA5 is in fact the functional
homolog of mouse GATA4 [27], and so it remained an
open question as to whether GATA4 is required for devel-
opment of the mammalian liver. Development of Gata4-/
- mouse embryos arrests prior to the onset of pancreatic
and liver specification due to deficiencies in the differen-
tiation of the extraembryonic endoderm [28,29]. How-
ever, as is the case for Gata6-/- embryos, this early
embryonic lethality can be circumvented by providing
Gata4-/- embryos with a Gata4+/+ extraembryonic endo-
derm by tetraploid embryo complementation [30,31]. We
therefore used this approach to generate post-gastrulation
stage embryos from Gata4-/- ES cells in order to defini-
tively determine whether GATA4 controls development of
the mammalian pancreas or liver. Examination of such
Gata4-/- ES cell-derived embryos revealed that GATA4 is
necessary for expansion of the primary hepatic rudiment
and is required for the onset of ventral pancreatic develop-
ment but dispensable for formation of the dorsal pan-
creas.
Results
GATA4 is expressed in multiple tissues with roles in 
development of the pancreas and liver
As a first step toward defining GATA4 function in the
development of the liver and pancreas, we carried out a
detailed analysis of GATA4 expression in these tissues in 4
to 25 somite stage (E8.0 – E10.0) embryos using immu-
nohistochemistry. We have previously demonstrated that
the antibody used in these studies specifically recognizes
GATA4 because it does not detect nuclear staining in
GATA4 null embryos [31]. At the 4 somite stage, the ven-
tral definitive endoderm, which will give rise to the liver
and ventral pancreas, is continuous with the extraembry-
onic visceral endoderm (Fig. 1A,B). HNF4 α is expressed
exclusively in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm at
this stage and clearly demarcates this tissue from the ven-
tral foregut endoderm, which lies adjacent to the cardiac

in the extraembryonic visceral endoderm, GATA4 is also
detected in the ventral foregut endoderm as well as in the
cardiac mesoderm (Fig. 1B). By the 16 somite stage, clo-
sure of the foregut and morphogenetic movements of the
splanchnic and lateral mesoderm has drawn the newly
specified hepatic and pancreatic rudiments within the
endoderm away from the cardiac mesoderm and into con-
tact with surrounding mesenchyme of the septum trans-
versum. At this stage, GATA4 is detected throughout theforegut endoderm including the liver bud. However,
GATA4 levels within the liver bud appear to be lower than
that observed in the adjacent septum transversum mesen-
chyme (Fig. 1C), the endothelial cells that surround the
bud, and the ventral pancreas (Fig. 1D). Following forma-
tion of the primary liver bud, the hepatic endoderm pro-
liferates, delaminates, and migrates into the septum
transversum mesenchyme, while the pancreatic bud
maintains an epithelial morphology. In 25 somite stage
embryos GATA4 expression is absent from cells delami-
nating from the primary liver bud. The loss of GATA4
expression in this region appears to be specific to the cells
that are committed to the hepatic lineage because intense
GATA4 staining can be identified within the remainder of
the foregut as well as in the septum transversum mesen-
chyme and ventral pancreatic bud (Fig. 1E,F) [31]. These
data demonstrate that GATA4 expression is highly
dynamic during the time that the ventral foregut endo-
derm differentiates to produce the liver and ventral pan-
creatic cell lineages. These expression analyses, which
yield data that are similar to those reported elsewhere
[16,20,22], are consistent with a role for GATA4 in the
potentiation of hepatic gene expression prior to forma-
tion of the liver bud and in controlling development of
the pancreas. However, the observation that GATA4
expression in the hepatic endoderm is rapidly extin-
guished as the hepatoblasts delaminate from the foregut
suggests that any cell autonomous role for GATA4 during
hepatogenesis is likely to be restricted to the earliest
phases of hepatic development. Moreover, our finding
that GATA4 is also highly expressed in the cardiac meso-
derm, septum transversum mesenchyme, and endothelial
cells, all of which contribute paracrine signals that are nec-
essary for hepatic and pancreatic development, suggests
that GATA4 could also regulate endoderm development
indirectly.
GATA4 is necessary for expansion of the liver bud
We have previously shown that producing embryos from
ES cells by tetraploid embryo complementation rescues
the extra-embryonic defects associated with GATA4
knockout embryos [31]. Development of Gata4-/- ES cell-
derived embryos arrests at approximately E9.5 and the
embryos exhibit defects in development of the proepicar-
dium and heart [31]. Although this gestational lethality
prevented analyses of GATA4 in controlling late stages of
pancreatic and hepatic organogenesis, the availability of
Gata4-/- E9.5 embryos allowed us to address the contribu-
tion of GATA4 to the onset of hepatic and pancreatic
development. In hematoxylin and eosin stained trans-
verse sections of control Gata4+/- ES cell-derived embryos,
the hepatic endoderm was seen to begin its expansion and
infiltration of the surrounding septum transversum mes-
enchyme (Fig. 2A), as is the case for naturally generated
wild type embryos (not shown). In contrast, the presump-GATA4 is expressed in multiple  tissues that contribute to development of the ventral pancreas and liverFigure 1

expand but instead remained as a small outgrowth of
endoderm with a pseudostratified epithelial morphology
that is characteristic of the primary liver bud [33] (Fig.
2B). We have examined over 20 mutant embryos from
GATA4-/- ES cells and the absence of liver bud expansion
was found to be fully penetrant.
Because studies of the Alb1 enhancer implicate a role for
GATA4 in the potentiation of hepatic gene expression
[23], we examined the expression of a number of hepato-
blast-expressed genes in these Gata4 null liver buds. Alb1
is one of the first markers of the hepatic endoderm [34]
and in situ hybridisation analysis using an anti-sense Alb1
probe uncovered the presence Alb1 mRNAs within the
expanding liver bud of Gata4+/- embryos (Fig. 2C). In
Gata4 null embryos (Fig. 2D), Alb1 expression can be
detected in the presumptive liver bud, but was less exten-
sive than that observed in Gata4+/- embryos. The hepatic
transcription factor HNF4 α is expressed in the liver bud
from around the 15 somite stage, and we were able to
detect HNF4 α expression within the hepatic endoderm of
both Gata4+/- and Gata4-/- embryos (Fig. 2E,F) by immu-
nohistochemistry using an antibody that specifically iden-
tifies HNF4 α [35]. Cumulatively, these data suggest that
specification of the hepatic lineage occurs in the absence
of GATA4 although the cells of the Gata4-/- liver bud fail to
delaminate and expand. To confirm that hepatic specifica-
tion occurs relatively normally in the absence of GATA4,
we examined the expression of several hepatic genes in the
ventral endoderm of Gata4-/- embryos at E8.0–8.5, which
is approximately the developmental stage at which the
hepatic lineage is specified. RT-PCR was performed on
RNA isolated from the ventral foregut endoderm (demar-
cated by black arrowheads in Fig. 1A) of individual
Gata4+/- and Gata4-/- embryos. As shown in Fig. 3, we were
able to detect Gata4 transcripts in the ventral endoderm of
Gata4+/- but not Gata4-/- embryos, which demonstrates
that the dissected samples of definitive foregut endoderm
were not contaminated by GATA4-expressing wild type
(tetraploid) extraembryonic visceral endoderm. The
exclusion of contaminating extraembryonic endoderm
from the isolated samples is crucial because the extraem-
bryonic endoderm expresses many of the same genes as
the hepatic endoderm [36], and so the presence of this tis-
sue could potentially confound interpretation of collected
data. We were able to detect expression of Gata6 , FoxA2 ,
Hnf4a , Hex, Afp, Alb1, Rbp and Ttr mRNAs in the isolated
ventral foregut of both Gata4+/- and Gata4-/- embryos (Fig.
3) suggesting that there is no gross disruption to hepatic
gene expression in the absence of GATA4 at early develop-
mental stages. Therefore, although hepatic development
is compromised in Gata4 null embryos, the endoderm
retains the capacity to form a pseudo-stratified epithelial
bud and initiate a program of hepatic gene expression.Although GATA4 is expressed in the early developing
endoderm, the level of GATA4 protein drops to levels that
are undetectable by immunohistochemistry at around the
time the liver bud expands and the cells delaminate. This
implies that the failure of the liver bud to expand and
invade the surrounding mesenchyme is likely to reflect a
non-cell autonomous role for GATA4 during hepatogene-
sis. Consistent with this proposal, GATA4 was also identi-
fied in the cardiac mesoderm, septum transversum
mesenchyme and endothelium surrounding the liver bud,
all of which are crucial for the development of the hepatic
domain [5,37]. We have previously shown that although
loss of GATA4 affects development of the ventricular car-
diomyocytes, there is relatively little impact on cardiac
gene expression possibly due to compensation by GATA6
[31]. A comparison of transverse sections from Gata4+/-
and Gata4-/- embryos reveals that the septum transversum
mesenchyme, which lies adjacent to the presumptive liver
bud in control embryos, is absent in Gata4-/- embryos (Fig.Analysis of hepatic gene expression in Gata4-/- embryos Figure 3

foregut endoderm of 4 individual Gata4+/- embryos (lanes 1–
4) and 7 individual Gata4-/- embryos (lanes 5–11). The somite 
number of each embryo is  given above each lane. Gata4-/- 
ventral endoderm does not express Gata4 (lanes 5–11) con-
firming the genotype of these embryos and the clean dissec-
tion of the foregut endoderm from wild type extraembryonic 
visceral endoderm. Amplification of Hprt was used to control 
for loading and amplification of  samples lacking reverse tran-
scriptase (-RT) or cDNA (lane 12) confirmed the absence of 
contaminating DNA.

(page number not for citation purposes)2A,B). The apparent absence of this mesenchyme was con-
firmed by immunohistochemical staining (Fig. 2G,H) for
WT1 [38]. These data are consistent with our previously
published analyses of the septum transversum and
proepicardium in Gata4-/- embryos [31]. Next, we exam-
ined whether endothelial cells, which normally line the
ventro-lateral surface of the hepatic epithelium, were
present in Gata4-/- embryos. We were able to detect plate-
let endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM) positive
cells on the surface of the liver bud in Gata4+/- and Gata4-
/- embryos (Fig. 2I,J) suggesting that the presence of
endothelial cells alone are insufficient to induce the out-
growth of the hepatic diverticulum. Although it is possible
that GATA4 specifically regulates expression of an essen-
tial signalling molecule from the endothelium or cardio-
mycoytes, we believe it more likely that the absence of the
septum transversum mesenchyme in Gata4 null embryos
accounts for the failure of the outgrowth of the hepatic
endoderm in these embryos.
GATA4 is essential for formation of the ventral pancreatic 
bud
GATA4 expression is maintained in the ventral pancreatic
endoderm as expression is extinguished in the hepatic
endoderm (Fig. 1). We therefore analysed the develop-
ment of the ventral pancreas in the Gata4 null embryos to
determine whether GATA4 contributes toward pancreatic
development. In transverse hematoxylin and eosin-
stained sections through Gata4+/- embryos, the ventral
pancreas can be identified as an epithelial thickening on
the ventral aspect of the foregut surrounded by mesen-
chyme that is caudal to the liver bud (Fig. 4A). However,
examination of a similar plane through Gata4-/- embryos
revealed that the ventral region of the foregut endoderm
caudal to the liver bud is morphologically indistinguisha-
ble from the rest of the foregut, suggesting that ventral
pancreatic development is impaired (Fig. 4B).
The transcription factor PDX1 is among the earliest
expressed proteins in both the ventral and dorsal pancre-
atic rudiments and provides one of the few markers that
define the ventral pancreas at this developmental stage
[6,39]. As expected, we were able to detect PDX1 expres-
sion by immunohistochemistry in the ventral pancreas of
Gata4+/- embryos at E9.5 (Fig. 4C). In contrast, PDX1
expression was undetectable in the equivalent endoder-
mal region in Gata4-/- embryos (Fig. 4D). Indeed, we
failed to observe any PDX1 expression in the ventral
aspect of the entire gut endoderm (data not shown). How-
ever, we were able to detect PDX1, as well as a second pan-
creatic protein HB9, in the dorsal pancreatic domain of
both control and mutant embryos (Fig. 4E,F,G) implying
that the loss of GATA4 specifically affects development of
the ventral pancreas.The pancreatic phenotype described above exhibits many
similarities to the ventral pancreatic defects observed in
Hex null embryos [6,33]. The hepatic and ventral pancre-
atic lineages are specified from two distinct domains of
the ventral foregut endoderm. Signals from the overlying
cardiac mesoderm instruct the more dorsal endoderm to
assume a hepatic fate [1]. The ventral-most endoderm is
beyond the influence of these signals and as a result
adopts a pancreatic fate. In Hex null embryos, reduced
proliferation of the ventral foregut endoderm results in a
failure to elaborate endoderm beyond the hepatic induc-
tive influence of the cardiac mesoderm. Consequently, the
ventral pancreas is not specified, with PDX1 expression
absent in E9.5 Hex null embryos [6]. To examine whether
the ventral pancreatic defects observed in Gata4 null
embryos are a consequence of a similar mechanism, we
examined the development of the ventral foregut endo-
derm at around the 6 somite stage. In Hex null embryos,
the failure of the ventral foregut endoderm to proliferate
is characterised by a dorsal ingression of the visceral
extraembryonic endoderm [6]. Using HNF4 α as a marker
that specifically identifies the extraembrynoic visceral
endoderm at this developmental stage, we found that the
positioning of the visceral extraembryonic endoderm rel-
ative to the ventral foregut and cardiac mesoderm
between Gata4+/- or Gata4-/- embryos was indistinguisha-
ble. These data suggest that the failure of ventral pancreas
specification in Gata4 null embryos is via a mechanism
distinct from that observed in Hex-/- embryos. This inter-
pretation is supported by RT-PCR analysis of the ventral
endoderm that shows comparable levels of Hex mRNA
expression between Gata4+/- and Gata4-/- embryos (Fig. 3).
We have previously shown that GATA6 expression over-
laps with GATA4 in the ventral foregut endoderm and that
hepatic development is blocked in Gata6 null embryos
[22]. The identification of a ventral pancreatic phenotype
in Gata4 null embryos led us to examine whether pancre-
atic development was affected in Gata6 null embryos. As
is the case for GATA4, loss of GATA6 results in embryonic
lethality during gastrulation due to deficiencies in the
development of the extraembryonic endoderm, which
could be circumvented by generating embryos from
Gata6-/- ES cells by tetraploid embryo complementation
[22]. At the 20 somite stage of development, Gata6+/- con-
trol embryos were found to express PDX1 in the ventral
pancreas (Fig. 5A). In Gata6-/- embryos, we were able to
detect PDX1 positive cells in the ventral foregut. However,
there appeared to be fewer of these cells in comparison to
controls. Moreover, we also noted that the levels of PDX1
appeared to be lower in those PDX1 positive cells identi-
fied in Gata6-/- embryos relative to controls, which
robustly expressed PDX1. Together these results demon-
strate that the development of the pancreatic epithelium

as that observed for loss of GATA4.
Discussion
The generation of embryos from Gata4 null ES cells by
tetraploid complementation has allowed us to examine
the development of the mammalian liver and pancreas
from the ventral foregut endoderm in the absence of
either GATA4 or GATA6. Studies on the transcriptional
control of the Alb1 gene have implicated GATA transcrip-
tion factors, and in particular GATA4, as being crucial dur-
ing the early development of the liver. In the ventral
foregut endoderm, GATA4, along with FOXA2, has been
shown to bind to Alb1 transcriptional regulatory elements
prior to the onset of hepatic gene expression [3,23]. The
ability of GATA4 and FOXA2 to alter chromatin structure
has led to the hypothesis that these two proteins act to
potentiate hepatic gene expression by preparing the pro-
moters and enhancers of hepatic genes for the action of
transcriptional activators [24]. While our studies support
a role for GATA4 and GATA6 during liver development, it
is clear that the contribution of these two GATA factors is
complex, with both factors acting dynamically at distinct
stages of hepatic development and likely having both cell
autonomous and non-autonomous roles.
The expression pattern of GATA4 points to a transient
function for this gene during the earliest stages of hepatic
development. This is compatible with GATA4 acting as a
pioneer factor within the ventral endoderm during liver
development. However, our finding that expression of
liver genes is relatively unaffected in the hepatic endo-
derm between the 6–12 somite stage and that formation
of a pseudostratified epithelial bud can be detected in
Gata4 null embryos suggests that GATA4 is not essentialfor the onset of a hepatic developmental program. How-
ever, since both GATA4 and GATA6 are expressed in the
ventral endoderm and both bind identical regulatory ele-
ments in target promoters, it seems reasonable to consider
that the function of these two factors overlaps to facilitate
the expression of liver genes during hepatic specification.
GATA6 has been predicted to compensate for GATA4
function in a number of other studies, and Gata4+/-Gata6+/
- mouse embryos arrest during midgestation stages of
development due to cardiovascular defects [29-31,40].
Moreover, direct evidence supporting the proposal that
GATA4 and GATA6 have functionally redundant roles
during specification of the liver that are evolutionarily
conserved come from studies in zebrafish [26]. Holtzinger
and Evans have demonstrated that depletion of either
zfGATA4 or zfGATA6 prevents expansion of the primary
liver bud but does not block specification whereas deple-
tion of both factors results in the absence of any detecta-
ble hepatic endoderm.
Although the specification of the hepatic lineage and ini-
tial formation of the liver bud appears relatively normal in
Gata4 null mouse embryos, the liver bud fails to expand.
Based on the observation that GATA4 is undetectable in
the hepatic endoderm as it expands into the adjacent sep-
tum transversum mesenchyme, it appears unlikely that
GATA4 has a cell autonomous role in this process in
mammals. Tissue explant studies in chick and mouse have
shown that an interaction with the septum transversum
mesenchyme is crucial for the expansion of the liver bud,
an effect that can be mediated by the growth factors BMP2
and 4 [5,41,42]. In Gata4 null embryos, the absence of
septum transversum mesenchyme adjacent to the liver
bud would, therefore, be predicted to result in a failure in
growth factor signalling necessary to drive expansion of
the liver diverticulum. This in turn would imply that the
failure of the Gata4-/- liver bud to expand reflects a second-
ary effect caused by the failure of the septum transversum
mesenchyme to develop rather than a cell autonomous
requirement for GATA4 within the hepatic endoderm.
The identification of defects in ventral pancreas develop-
ment in Gata4 and Gata6 null embryos reveals roles for
GATA factors in this tissue. Specification of the ventral
pancreas, as defined by expression of Pdx1 , can be
detected at the 7–8 somite stage in the ventral-most
foregut endoderm. Specification of the ventral pancreas is
dependent on the endoderm being positioned beyond the
influence of FGF signals that originate from the cardiac
mesoderm that specify the liver primordium [1]. Exami-
nation of Gata4 null embryos at the 20 somite stage
implied a complete absence of ventral pancreatic tissue
that expresses PDX1. In Gata6 null embryos, although
some PDX1 positive cells could be detected, their abun-
dance was reduced. However, in contrast to the ventralDevelopment of the ventral pancreas is curtailed in Gata6-/- embryosFigure 5

somite (E9.5) Gata6+/- (A) and Gata6-/- embryos by immuno-
histochemistry staining of the ventral pancreas (brown stain, 
white arrowheads) in both Gata6+/- and Gata6-/- embryos, 
however there was considerably fewer PDX1 positive cells in 
the ventral pancreas (B; brow n stain, white arrowhead). 
PDX1 positive cells were also detected in the presumptive 
dorsal pancreatic region of Gata6-/- embryos (B; brown stain, 
black arrowhead). Scale bar = 50 μM

(page number not for citation purposes)pancreas, we were able to detect PDX1 and Hb9 in the
dorsal pancreatic rudiment in Gata4 or Gata6 null
embryos. This presumably reflects the fact that the tissue
interactions and growth factor requirements necessary for
development of the ventral pancreas are distinct from
those of the dorsal pancreas [43].
The absence of a ventral pancreas in Gata4 null embryos
is similar to that of embryos that lack the transcription fac-
tor Hex [6,44]. In the absence of Hex, the morphology of
the ventral foregut endoderm is compromised such that
the subset of cells normally specified to become pancreas
failed to extend beyond the inductive affect of the cardiac
mesoderm. Consequently, the ventral pancreas was
absent in these embryos as the ventral foregut endoderm
followed an alternate fate [6]. However, analyses of
explant cultures of endoderm revealed that Hex-/-foregut
endoderm retained the capacity to express pancreatic
genes demonstrating that the absence of the ventral pan-
creas was not cell autonomous. Although, like Hex-/-
embryos, loss of GATA4 prevents formation of the ventral
pancreas, the mechanism seems to be distinct because in
contrast to Hex-/- embryos morphogenesis of the foregut
appears to occur normally in Gata4-/- embryos. The possi-
bility therefore exists that the GATA factors regulate ven-
tral pancreatic development by potentiating pancreatic
gene expression as has been proposed for the liver. This
possibility is supported by a recent study showing that the
Glucagon promoter can be directly activated by GATA4 in
cell culture [21]. Although both GATA4 and GATA6 are
expressed (data not shown) in the mesenchyme adjacent
to the pancreatic endoderm and could, therefore, have cell
non-autonomous roles during pancreatic development,
studies using transgenic mouse embryos are consistent
with a requirement for the GATA factors in the endoderm
[16]. Decker et al generated transgenic mouse embryos
that expressed GATA4 and GATA6 proteins fused to the
Engrailed repressor domain within the developing pan-
creatic rudiments of transgenic mouse embryos using a
Pdx1 promoter. Although the mechanism of action of
GATA-Engrailed fusion proteins is likely to be complex,
examination of five independent E17.5 GATA6-Engrailed
transgenic embryos revealed that the pancreas was unde-
tectable in three, while two displayed a severe disruption
to pancreatic morphology. Similar expression of a GATA4-
Engrailed fusion was less dramatic with one out of eight
embryos displaying an abnormal pancreatic morphology.
Conclusion
We have identified GATA4 and GATA6 as key transcrip-
tion factors that act to control the development of the
hepatic and pancreatic lineages from the ventral foregut
endoderm. A comparison of the expression profiles of
these factors implies that these two factors have a complex
functional relationship during this developmental regula-tion that likely involves both cell autonomous and non-
autonomous roles. The precise cell type-specific contribu-
tion made by these factors during pancreatic and liver
development of these tissues should be resolved by the
endodermal or mesenchymal specific deletion of GATA4
and GATA6 by Cre-loxP technologies using available con-
ditional alleles for Gata4 and Gata6 [31,45]. In addition,
it is likely that these factors have both redundant and spe-
cific functions during development, which could be
resolved by generating embryos from ES cells that are null
for both GATA4 and GATA6.
Methods
Generation of ES cell-derived embryos
The generation of Gata4-/- and Gata6-/- ES cells and forma-
tion of ES-cell derived embryos by complementation with
tetraploid embryos has been reported previously
[22,31,46]. The Medical College of Wisconsin's Animal
Care Committee approved all animal procedures used in
this study. PMSG used in super ovulation was obtained
from A.F. Parlow at the National Hormone and Peptide
Program.
Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry was performed using antigen
retrieval as described previously [47] using the following
antibodies: GATA4 and HNF4 α (Santa Cruz Biotechnol-
ogy), Wilms' Tumor (WT1) (Cell Marque), Platelet
endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM, CD31, BD
Pharmingen) and PDX1 (gift of Dr Christopher Wright,
Vanderbilt University, Tennessee).
In situ Hybridization
Embryos were dehydrated by alcohol series and embed-
ded in paraffin and sections were cut at 7 μm. Slides were
subsequently processed for in situ hybridization with P33-
labeled anti-sense RNA probes as described previously
[32,48]. Experimental and control images were processed
identically using Adobe Photoshop.
RT-PCR
RT-PCR was carried out using total RNA isolated (RNeasy
Mini Prep Kit, Qiagen) from ventral endoderm dissected
from embryos as described previously [46] using the fol-
lowing primers: Hprt1 ; agcgcaagttgaatctgc, agcgacaatctac-
