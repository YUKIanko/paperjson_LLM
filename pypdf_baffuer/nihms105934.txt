Abstract
Cardiac malformations due to aberrant development of the atrioventricular (AV) valves are among
the most common forms of congenital heart disease. At localized swellings of extracellular matrix
known as the endocardial cushions, the endothelial lining of the heart undergoes an epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) to form the mesenchymal progenitors of the AV valves. Further
growth and differentiation of these mesenchymal precursors results in the formation of portions of
the atrial and ventricular septae, and the generation of thin, pliable valves. Gata4 , which encodes a
zinc finger transcription factor, is expressed in the endothelium and mesenchyme of the AV valves.
Using a Tie2-Cre  transgene, we selectively inactivated Gata4  within endothelial-derived cells.
Mutant endothelium failed to undergo EMT, resulting in hypocellular cushions. Mutant cushions had
decreased levels of Erbb3 , an EGF-family receptor essential for EMT in the atrioventricular cushions.
In Gata4  mutant embryos, Erbb3  downregulation was associated with impaired activation of Erk,
which is also required for EMT. Expression of a Gata4 mutant protein defective in interaction with
Friend of Gata (FOG) cofactors rescued the EMT defect, but resulted in a decreased proliferation of
mesenchyme and hypoplastic cushions that failed to septate the ventricular inlet. We demonstrate
two novel functions of Gata4 in development of the AV valves. First, Gata4 functions as an upstream
regulator of an Erbb3-Erk  pathway necessary for EMT, and second, Gata4 acts to promote cushion
mesenchyme growth and remodeling.

et al., 2000). Development of the AV valvuloseptal complex can be considered to occur in
several steps (reviewed by Armstrong and Bischoff, 2004). First, endocardial cells at the AV
canal (AVC) undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), forming mesenchymal
cells that invade swellings of extracellular matrix to form the endocardial cushions (EC). Next,
the cellularized superior and inferior EC grow and fuse, forming the AV valvuloseptal complex
that divides the ventricular inflow into a right and a left AV valve. Further elongation and
remodeling of the cushions results in formation of the mature valve leaflets.
Transformation of AV endocardium to cushion mesenchyme requires the input of multiple
signaling molecules secreted from the adjacent myocardium, including Tgf β and Egf family
members (Camenisch et al., 2000; Nakajima et al., 2000a; Sugi et al., 2004; Rivera-Feliciano
and Tabin, 2006 ). Ablation of Erbb3 , which encodes an Egf family receptor, results in failure
of endocardial cells of the AV cushions to undergo EMT to form cushion mesenchyme
(Camenisch et al., 2000). One mechanism by which Erbb3 promotes EMT is to activate Ras
(Camenisch et al., 2000). Decreased Ras signaling results in defective EMT (Camenisch et al.,
2000 ; Lakkis and Epstein, 1998), and, conversely, increased Ras signaling results in increased
EMT and hypercellular, enlarged EC (Gitler et al., 2003; Lakkis and Epstein, 1998).
The transcription factor Gata4 is essential for heart formation (Kuo et al., 1997; Molkentin et
al., 1997; Watt et al., 2004 ; Zeisberg et al., 2005). In humans, GATA4  heterozygous mutations
have been associated with defects in the muscular septum separating atria or ventricles, and
variably associated with valvar pulmonary stenosis (Garg et al., 2003; Hirayama-Yamada et
al., 2005; Okubo et al., 2004). In addition to its expression in the myocardium, Gata4  is robustly
expressed in the endocardium and the EC (Charron and Nemer, 1999; Heikinheimo et al.,
1994 ). This expression pattern, and the presence of EC defects in mouse embryos homozygous
for two different hypomorphic Gata4  alleles (Crispino et al., 2001 ; Pu et al., 2004 ), suggested
that Gata4 might be an important regulator of EC development.
To further investigate the role of Gata4 in EC development, we specifically inactivated
Gata4  in endothelium and endothelium-derived cushion mesenchyme. We show that Gata4
expression in endothelium-derived cells is required at two stages of AV valve formation,
illustrating novel cell-autonomous roles for Gata4 in the endocardium. First, Gata4 is required
to promote EMT of endocardial cells to generate AV cushion mesenchyme. Second, Gata4
activity in endocardial-derived cells is required later during AV valve maturation for growth
and remodeling of the AV cushions to septate the ventricular inlet.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
Gata4H and Gata4flox alleles (Fig. 1A) have been described previously (Pu et al., 2004 ;Zeisberg
et al., 2005). Gata4H expresses reduced amounts of protein compared with the wild-type allele
(Pu et al., 2004). Gata4wt/Ki and R26R stoplacZ  mice (Crispino et al., 2001;Mao et al., 1999)
were obtained from Stuart Orkin (Harvard Medical School). Transgenic mice expressing
Cre from Tie2 (also known as Tek) regulatory elements ( T2Cre ) were obtained from M.
Yanagisawa (Kisanuki et al., 2001). Wnt1-Cre  mice (Danielian et al., 1998) were obtained
from Jackson Laboratories. All mice were maintained in a mixed C57BL6/129 genetic
background. Gata4wt/flox; T2Cre+ mice were crossed with Gata4flox/flox mice to yield
Gata4flox/flox; T2Cre+ (Gata4T2del) mice. All animal care and procedures were performed
under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.Rivera-Feliciano et al. Page 2

Histology
Embryos were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde overnight at 4°C, and then paraffin-wax
embedded and sectioned at 10 µm. Alcian Blue staining was performed by using 0.15 mg/ml
Alcian Blue in 5% acetic acid. BrdU labeling and TUNEL staining were performed as described
previously (Zeisberg et al., 2005).
Tissue culture
For short-term embryo culture, E9.5 embryos were incubated in M199 supplemented with 1%
FBS for 30 minutes at 37°C in 5% CO 2. Heregulin (Sigma; 100 ng/ml) or U0126 (Calbiochem;
10 µM) were added as indicated.
AV explant culture was carried out as described (Rivera-Feliciano and Tabin, 2006). Where
indicated, U0126 (Calbiochem), vehicle (DMSO) or a growth factor cocktail [Tgf β2 (Cell
Biosciences), 50 ng/ml; Bmp2 (R&D Systems), 200 ng/ml; hyaluronic acid (Sigma), 500 ng/
ml; heregulin (Sigma), 50 ng/ml] was added to the media at the start of the explant culture.
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC; passage <6; Cambrex) were cultured in
complete endothelial growth media (Cambrex). BT20 human breast cancer cells (ATCC) were
transfected using Fugene6 (Roche).
Gene expression
Whole-mount staining for detection of β-galactosidase activity was performed as described
(Lobe et al., 1999). Immunostaining was performed using the following antibodies: Nfatc1
(1:200, Santa Cruz), Desmin (1:4, Biomeda), Chd5 (1:20, Santa Cruz), phospho-Erk1/2 (1:200,
Cell Signaling), α-SMACy3-conjugated (Clone 1A4, Sigma 1:200) and biotin-conjugated
CD31 (Pecam1, 1:100) monoclonal antibody (Clone MEC 13.3, BD Pharmingen). Erbb3
western blotting was performed with antibody C-17 (Santa Cruz, 1:200) and normalized to
Gapdh (Research Diagnostics, 1:10,000).
For RNA analysis, four mutant and four control RNA samples were prepared (Pico-Pure RNA
Isolation Kit, Arcturus), each consisting of 10 microdissected AVCs. Probe was prepared from
50 ng total RNA using an isothermal amplification protocol (NuGen), and hybridized to
Affymetrix Mouse 430 2.0 microarrays. Two control samples were excluded because of
excessive noise. We excluded probe sets that may cross-hybridize to unrelated targets (probe
name ending with ‘_x_at’) or that received ‘Absent’ calls across all samples. The 27,082
remaining probe sets were ranked by the ‘relative difference’ d-score (Tusher et al., 2001),
using the Significance Analysis of Microarray (SAM) software package
(http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/).
For quantitative RT-PCR, RNA samples were converted to cDNA and amplified by Ovation
isothermal amplification. The cDNA was then used for quantitative PCR on an ABI7300
thermal cycler, with Sybr Green or Taqman detection. Primer sequences are provided in Table
1.
In situ hybridization was performed on 10 µm paraffin sections using digoxigenin-labeled or
S35-labeled RNA probes as described (Brent et al., 2003; Tanaka et al., 1999). Signal from
S35-labeled probes was detected in dark field and pseudocolored red using PhotoShop. Sections
were counterstained with DAPI. For in situ hybridization probes refer to Table 1. Results shown
are representative of at least two embryos.Rivera-Feliciano et al. Page 3

Plasmids
The Gata4  expression construct has been described previously (Lee et al., 1998). The
Gata4Δex2 expression construct was generated by RT-PCR amplification of the Cre-
recombined Gata4  transcript. Gata4DBD-engrailed  was constructed by PCR cloning the Gata4
DNA-binding domain upstream of the engrailed repressor domain. The murine Erbb3  promoter
and intron 1 enhancer was cloned from a bacterial artificial chromosome by Red/ET
recombineering (GeneBridges) into pGL3-BASIC (Promega) or pGL3-promoter (Promega),
respectively. Luciferase assays were normalized for transfection efficiency using pRL-null
(Promega).
RESULTS
Endothelial-restricted Gata4  inactivation
To determine the function of Gata4 within the endocardium and its derivatives, we inactivated
a floxed Gata4  allele ( Gata4flox; Fig. 1A) (Pu et al., 2004 ;Zeisberg et al., 2005) by expressing
Cre recombinase from a Tie2 promoter ( T2Cre ) (Kisanuki et al., 2001). Cre-mediated
recombination of Gata4flox resulted in excision of a portion of exon 2, including the start codon
and 46% of the Gata4  coding region. The recombined allele ( Gata4Δex2) expresses a truncated
protein containing both zinc fingers and the C-terminal activation domain, but lacking the N-
terminal transactivation domains (see Fig. S1 in the supplementary material). The truncated
protein failed to activate multiple cardiac and intestinal Gata4 -dependent promoters in vitro
(Fig. S1 in the supplementary material; T. Bosse and S. Krasinski, personal communication),
consistent with previous results (Morrisey et al., 1997). These data, along with the observation
that embryos homozygous for this mutation in their germline ( Gata4Δex2/Δex2) resemble
previously reported mice carrying Gata4  null alleles (Kuo et al., 1997;Molkentin et al.,
1997) (data not shown), suggest that the Gata4Δex2 allele behaves as a loss-of-function
mutation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Gata4Δex2 retains partial function.
In control experiments, we characterized the spatiotemporal pattern of recombination catalyzed
by T2Cre  using the reporter R26RstoplacZ , which expresses lacZ only after activation by
Cre (Mao et al., 1999). In T2Cre+ ; R26RstoplacZ  embryos, T2Cre  activated reporter
expression in the majority of endocardial cells by E9.5 (Fig. 1B1,B2). lacZ expression was not
observed in epicardial or myocardial cells. Between E9.5 and E11.5, endocardial cells at the
AVC transform into mesenchymal cells and populate the AV cushions. Consistent with this
lineage history, mesenchymal cells of the AV cushions were recombined by Cre recombinase,
and consequently expressed the lacZ reporter at E9.5 and E11.5 (Fig. 1B1, arrow; 1B3,
asterisks).
The endocardium and EC mesenchyme of the developing heart express high levels of Gata4
(Fig. 1C,D) (Heikinheimo et al., 1994). To specifically inactivate Gata4  in endocardial-derived
cells, we generated embryos with the genotype Gata4flox/flox; T2Cre+ (Gata4T2del). We
examined expression of Gata4  in these embryos by in situ hybridization using an exon 2-
specific probe. In control embryos, Gata4  exon 2 transcripts were present in endocardial,
epicardial and myocardial cells (Fig. 1C1,C2). In Gata4T2del embryos, expression from the
Gata4  exon 2 probe was unchanged in the epicardium and myocardium (star and yellow
arrowheads, Fig. 1C3,C4), but expression in the endocardium was absent (white arrowheads,
Fig. 1C3,C4). At E11.5, robust expression was detected in AVC mesenchyme in control
embryos, but this tissue was largely deficient in Gata4T2del embryos (asterisks, Fig. 1D; see
below). The lack of detectable Gata4  transcripts in mutant endocardium was not due to non-
specific transcript degradation, or a general failure of endothelium to subspecialize into
endocardium, as mutant endocardium continued to express normal levels of Pecam , anRivera-Feliciano et al. Page 4

endothelial marker, and Nfatc1 , a marker of endothelium subspecialized to line the heart (data
not shown).
EC also contribute to formation of the outflow (OT) tract and the OT valves. However, only
the most proximal portion of OT cushion mesenchyme derives from endothelial progenitors
that were recombined by the T2Cre  transgene (yellow arrow, Fig. 1B). The bulk of OT cushion
mesenchyme is derived from neural crest, as demonstrated by fate mapping using the neural
crest restricted Wnt1Cre  transgene (Gitler et al., 2003;Verzi et al., 2005) (see Fig. S2 in the
supplementary material). Gata4  is expressed in OT endothelium and both endocardial- and
neural crest-derived OT mesenchyme (green arrow, Fig. 1D). Consistent with the lack of
T2Cre -mediated recombination in the mid and distal OT mesenchyme (green arrow, Fig. 1B3),
Gata4  expression in these regions was not affected in Gata4T2del embryos (green arrow, Fig.
1D).
Phenotypic characterization of Gata4T2del embryos
Out of 34 litters genotyped, no Gata4T2del mice survived to weaning. By E12.5, the prevalence
of Gata4T2del embryos was 80% less than expected based on Mendelian ratios (Fig. 2A). At
E12.5, surviving Gata4T2del embryos had pericardial effusion and peripheral hemorrhage,
which are hallmarks of embryos with heart failure (Fig. 2B,C). The liver was hypoplastic (Fig.
2B; see also Fig. S3 in the supplementary material). Histological examination of the heart
showed that these mutant embryos displayed a paucity of mesenchymal cells within the AV
cushions (Fig. 2D–G). Additionally, the mutant AV endocardium was multiple cell layers thick
at certain foci (arrow, Fig. 2G), whereas the AV endocardium of controls remained as a single
cell layer epithelial sheet (Fig. 2E). Although the myocardium appeared normal in the majority
of mutant embryos, in 30% of embryos (six out of 17 examined) the compact myocardium was
abnormally thin (Fig. S4 in the supplementary material).
The hypocellular AV cushion phenotype was 100% penetrant and was not due to increased
apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL staining (data not shown). A small and variable number of
mesenchymal cells were observed in mutant AV cushions. To determine the origin of these
cells, we fate mapped T2Cre -expressing cells using the R26RstoplacZ  reporter in control and
Gata4T2del mutant embryos (Fig. 3). We found that these cells were lacZ positive (arrowhead,
Fig. 3B), indicating that they are derived from endothelium and not from an alternative tissue
compartment, such as epicardium. In situ hybridization demonstrated that the residual
mesenchymal cells did not express Gata4  (data not shown). T2Cre -recombined mesenchyme
at the proximal tip of the OT cushions (yellow arrows, Fig. 3A,C) was missing in Gata4T2del
mutants (yellow arrows, Fig. 3B,D).
Gata4  is necessary for AV cushion EMT
The process of EMT can be recapitulated in vitro by culturing explants of the AVC in a three-
dimensional collagen gel (Runyan and Markwald, 1983). During EMT, endothelial cells first
undergo an activation step during which they lose their cell-cell contacts. The cells then adopt
an elongated morphology, upregulate mesenchymal markers such as SMA, and downregulate
endothelial markers such as Pecam. These activated cells subsequently invade and migrate
through the extracellular matrix to complete the transformation process.
When cultured in a collagen gel, control AVC explants produced a halo of invasive, migrating
cells with mesenchymal morphology (Fig. 4A). By contrast, mutant explants failed to generate
mesenchymal cells (Fig. 4B,C). Immunostaining with antibodies for SMA and Pecam
delineated three classes of endothelial cells at different stages of activation in all explants
examined: (1) rounded cells expressing Pecam but not SMA (arrow, Fig. 4D); (2) rare, round
transitional cells expressing SMA (white arrowhead, Fig. 4D); and (3) elongated, SMA-Rivera-Feliciano et al. Page 5

expressing cells (yellow arrowhead, Fig. 4D). By contrast, explants from Gata4T2del embryos
failed to produce mesenchymal, SMA-expressing cells (Fig. 4E). Mutant endothelium
appeared multi-layered in a manner reminiscent of the morphology of sectioned Gata4T2del
hearts (star, Fig. 4E; arrow, Fig. 2G). None of the aforementioned signs of endothelial cell
activation were detected in explants examined by immunostaining for Pecam and SMA. These
data suggest that endothelial recombination of Gata4  impairs the activation of endothelial cells
and blocks their transformation to invasive mesenchyme.
Having established an essential role for Gata4 in the transformation of AVC endocardial cells
to mesenchymal cells, we sought to elucidate the mechanism by which Gata4 acts in this
process. Because adjacent myocardium is known to influence endocardial EMT, we
investigated whether the endocardial inactivation of Gata4  blocked EMT in a non-cell-
autonomous manner. Myocardial differentiation and specification of atrioventricular canal
myocardium remained intact, as indicated by the patterns of expression of sarcomeric myosin,
the myocardial specific transcription factor Nkx2–5 , the chamber myocardium marker Nppa ,
and the AVC myocardial marker Tbx2  (Fig. 5; data not shown). Myocardial expression of
Bmp2  and Tgfβ2, known paracrine activators of EMT (Nakajima et al., 2000b ;Rivera- Feliciano
and Tabin, 2006;Sugi et al., 2004), was unchanged in Gata4T2del hearts (data not shown).
Furthermore, culture of control AVC explants directly next to Gata4T2del explants did not
rescue the EMT defect in mutant explants. Similarly, culture of explants in the presence of a
mixture of growth factors known to promote EMT (Tgf β2, Bmp2, heregulin and hyaluoronic
acid) did not rescue the EMT defect in mutant explants, but did robustly stimulate the formation
of mesenchymal cells in control explants. These data suggest that the phenotype of
Gata4T2del explants was not due to an absence of diffusible factor(s) produced by the
myocardium that promote EMT.
We also considered the possibility that Gata4  could regulate EMT through modulation of the
extracellular matrix, which is necessary for cushion mesenchyme formation (Camenisch et al.,
2000). However, the extracellular matrix of the AV cushions was still present in Gata4T2del
hearts, as assessed by binding of the stain Alcian Blue to acidic glycosaminoglycans present
in the cushion extracellular matrix (Fig. 5D). Moreover, addition hyaluronic acid directly to
explant cultures did not rescue the EMT defect of mutant explants (data not shown).
Gata4  regulates expression of Erbb3
We next turned our attention to cell-autonomous mechanisms that could account for the loss
of EMT in Gata4T2del embryos. Downregulation of Snail  as a result of Notch  signaling leads
to downregulation of VE-cadherin  (Cdh5 ), and is necessary for endocardial EMT ( Timmerman
et al., 2004). In Gata4T2del hearts, we did not find altered expression of components of this
pathway ( Notch1, HRT1  and Snail ) by in situ hybridization (Fig. 5C; data not shown) or of
Cdh5 by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 5E).
To identify genes whose altered expression might contribute to the Gata4T2del phenotype, we
performed genome-wide expression analysis using microarrays. We isolated RNA from the
AV region of mutant and control E9.5 hearts (between 30 and 33 somites), and used the RNA
to probe Affymetrix microarrays. We used the SAM algorithm (Tusher et al., 2001) to identify
genes with significantly altered expression (Table 2). For a subset of these, we used qRT-PCR
to validate differences in gene expression between mutant and control tissue (Fig. 6A). Out of
11 genes tested, qRT-PCR confirmed differential gene expression in four: Erbb3 ,
thrombospondin 1 ( Thbs1 ), plexin C1 ( Plxnc1 ), and tenascin C ( Tnc; Fig. 6A). We also
confirmed differential expression of Erbb3, Thbs1  and Plxnc1  by in situ hybridization (Fig.
6B).Rivera-Feliciano et al. Page 6

The downregulation of Erbb3  in Gata4T2del AV tissue was of particular interest. Egf family
ligands signal through Erbb3  to activate Ras and promote EMT, and in the absence of Erbb3
AV endothelium fails to form cushion mesenchyme (Camenisch et al., 2002). We confirmed
downregulation of Erbb3  transcripts by qRTPCR (Fig. 6A) and in situ hybridization (Fig. 6B),
and downregulation of Erbb3 protein by western blotting (Fig. 6C).
To obtain further evidence that Gata4  regulates Erbb3  expression, we investigated whether
ectopic expression of Gata4  in endothelial cells that normally lack this transcription factor is
sufficient to activate Erbb3  expression. Adenoviral expression of Gata4  in human umbilical
vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) caused a 5-fold upregulation of Erbb3  expression compared
with cells treated with a GFP-expressing adenovirus (Fig. 6D). The degree of upregulation is
likely to be even higher in Gata4 -expressing cells, as adenovirus transduced only 15–20% of
cells. Conversely, we investigated whether Gata  factors are necessary for Erbb3  expression in
at least some cellular contexts. For this experiment, we used BT20 breast carcinoma cells,
which natively express both Gata4 and Erbb3 proteins (Bouchard et al., 2005) (data not shown).
Expression of a dominant-negative Gata4DBD-engrailed fusion protein strongly decreased
Erbb3 transcript levels (Fig. 6E).
To determine whether Gata4  regulates Erbb3  expression at the level of transcription, we used
rVista 2.0 (Loots and Ovcharenko, 2004) to find Erbb3  non-coding sequences conserved
between mouse and human. Conserved non-coding sequences upstream of the putative
transcriptional start site and within the first intron were used to drive expression of luciferase
reporters. We found that co-transfected Gata4 stimulated transcription from both the promoter
and the intronic enhancer (Fig. 6F). By contrast, the truncated protein produced by the
Gata4Δex2 allele failed to stimulate transcription from these Erbb3  regulatory elements (Fig.
6F). These regulatory elements contain three predicted GATA motifs conserved between
mouse and human. In mobility shift experiments, the two consensus sites in the enhancer
strongly bound Gata4, whereas the site in the promoter (nonconsensus GATG site) did not.
Mutation of these sites did not significantly alter transcriptional stimulation by Gata4  (see Fig.
S5 in the supplementary material).
Gata4  regulates an Erbb3-Erk  pathway required for EMT
Next, we wished to determine whether Gata4T2del AV endothelium was functionally deficient
in the transduction of Egf signals. We treated E9.5 Gata4T2del and control embryos with the
Erbb3  ligand heregulin, and measured the phosphorylation of Erk, which is activated
downstream of Ras. In heregulin-treated control embryos, activated Erk was readily observed
in AV cushion endothelium (arrowheads, Fig. 7A, middle panel). By contrast, in heregulin-
treated Gata4T2del embryos, Erk activation was strongly reduced in AV cushion endothelium
(arrowheads, Fig. 7A, bottom panel). Erk activation in myocardium did not differ between
genotypes (arrows, Fig. 7A), indicating that the downregulation in cushion endothelium was
specific and unlikely to be due to technical factors.
We then investigated whether defective Erk activation downstream of Erbb3  might account
for the marked reduction in EMT seen in the Gata4T2del AV cushions. We treated control and
mutant explants with U0126, a selective inhibitor of Erk activation. We found that U0126
strongly reduced the extent of EMT in wild-type explants (Fig. 7B). We reasoned that if
Gata4  and Erk are mutually required for EMT, then partial antagonism of each would inhibit
EMT. To test this hypothesis, we generated AVC explants homozygous for Gata4H, a Gata4
allele that expresses reduced levels of Gata4 protein (Pu et al., 2004). We treated Gata4H/H
and littermate control explants with a 50% inhibitory concentration of U0126 (400 nM). In the
presence of vehicle, Gata4H/H and control explants generated comparable numbers of
mesenchymal cells. However, the number of mesenchymal cells generated by Gata4H/H
explants treated with 400 nM U0126 was significantly reduced when compared with theRivera-Feliciano et al. Page 7

number generated by similarly treated control explants (Fig. 7C). This result is consistent with
a model in which Gata4  and Erk act in the same genetic pathway to promote EMT.
Gata4  is required for growth and remodeling of the AV cushions
Constitutive, partial loss of Gata4 function, as a result of either decreased protein expression
(Gata4H/H) or a point mutation abrogating Fog1  and Fog2  (Zfpm1  and Zfpm2 , respectively –
Mouse Genome Informatics) interaction ( Gata4Ki/Ki), resulted in embryonic lethality between
E12.5–E16.5 (Crispino et al., 2001; Pu et al., 2004). These embryos had common
atrioventricular canal defects, indicating a severe abnormality of EC maturation such that the
superior and inferior cushions failed to fuse and divide the ventricular inflow tract into separate
inlets for the right and left ventricle. This abnormality could, in principle, have been caused
by impaired Gata4 function in the endocardium, or by defective Gata4 function in the
myocardium with secondary abnormalities in the EC due to abnormal paracrine signaling. To
determine whether there is a cell-autonomous requirement for Gata4 in later atrioventricular
valve maturation, we generated embryos with the genotype Gata4flox/Ki; T2Cre+  (abbreviated
Gata4T2del/Ki). In these embryos, Gata4flox complements Gata4Ki except in the endothelium
and its derivatives, where T2Cre -mediated recombination inactivates it.
Gata4Ki/flox; T2Cre − control mice were present at weaning at the expected Mendelian
frequency and had no obvious heart defects. By contrast, Gata4T2del/Ki embryos were present
in the expected Mendelian ratio at E16.5, but were not present at weaning (out of eight litters
genotyped), indicating lethality in late gestation or in the perinatal period. Mutant embryos
examined at E16.5 had severe peripheral hemorrhage and edema, consistent with heart failure
(data not shown). At E12.5, the heart (Fig. 8A–D) and the liver appeared normal (Fig. 8A,B).
However, in later stage embryos, the AV valve leaflets were hypoplastic, and failure of fusion
of the superior and inferior AV cushions resulted in a common atrioventricular canal defect
(asterisk, Fig. 8E,F). Cell death was not increased in mutant cushions, as measured by TUNEL
staining at E12.5 and E15.5 (data not shown). However, cell proliferation, as measured by
BrdU uptake, was decreased in mutant cushion mesenchyme at E12.5 and E13.5 (Fig. 8G, data
not shown). These data suggest that Gata4-Fog  interaction within endocardium-derived cells
is required for normal proliferation of the AV cushions.
DISCUSSION
We used a T2Cre  transgene to recombine a conditional Gata4  allele ( Gata4flox) within
endothelial-derived cells and demonstrated that Gata4  is required at two stages of AVC
morphogenesis. First, Gata4  is necessary for endothelial EMT to form AV cushion
mesenchyme. Second, Gata4  is necessary for the growth and remodeling of the AV cushions,
after they have been populated by mesenchymal cells. Gata4  interaction with Fog cofactors
within endothelial-derived cells is dispensable for the former, but required for the latter.
The AV cushions are largely formed by mesenchyme derived from endothelial cells (see Fig.
1B, Fig. 3). Inactivation of Gata4  within endothelial-derived cells results in a marked decrease
in the number of mesenchymal cells in the AV cushions (Fig. 2). By contrast, the OT cushions
are formed by cells derived from at least two sources. OT endothelium undergoes EMT to form
the mesenchyme of the proximal OT cushions, whereas neural crest contributes to the mid-
and distal OT cushions (Fig. 1B; Fig. 3; see also Fig. S2 in the supplementary material).
Gata4  is expressed in both the neural crest-derived and endothelial-derived portions of the OT
cushions. However, its expression in the neural crest-derived portion is not required for normal
OT development, as Gata4  inactivation by Wnt1Cre  was compatible with normal survival and
normal OT morphogenesis (W.T.P., unpublished). Gata4  expression was required to form the
proximal, endothelial-derived portion of the OT cushion (Fig. 3). Because Gata4T2del embryos
do not survive to a stage at which mature OT valves are evident, we were unable to determineRivera-Feliciano et al. Page 8

what effect the loss of this portion of OT cushion has on OT valve development. Congenital
abnormalities of the pulmonary valve are associated with human GATA4  mutation (Garg et al.,
2003; Hirayama-Yamada et al., 2005 ;Okubo et al., 2004), suggesting that Gata4 activity within
the proximal, endothelial-derived portion of the OT cushions may be important for
development of the OT valves.
Gata4  function in formation of AV mesenchyme
Inactivation of Gata4  within endothelial-derived cells blocked endocardial EMT, resulting in
a paucity of mesenchymal cells within the AV cushions. This was associated with strong
downregulation of Erbb3  (Fig. 6). Using heterologous expression systems, we show that Gata4
modulates Erbb3  transcript levels and transcriptional activity of Erbb3  regulatory elements
(Fig. 6F). Although these regulatory elements contain evolutionarily conserved GATA binding
sites, these binding sites were not required for transcriptional stimulation by Gata4 in vitro (see
Fig. S5 in the supplementary material). These data suggest that Gata4  may regulate Erbb3
indirectly. Alternatively, these findings might represent limitations of the in vitro assay system.
Additional in vivo studies of Erbb3  regulatory elements will be necessary to elucidate the
mechanism by which Gata4  regulates Erbb3  in the endocardial cushions.
Downregulation of Erbb3  in Gata4T2del AVCs was associated with impaired Erk activation in
response to the Erbb3 ligand heregulin (Fig. 7A). Erk activation was necessary for endocardial
EMT (Fig. 7B). Partial inhibition of both Gata4 and Erk impaired the formation of cushion
mesenchyme (Fig. 7C). This synthetic phenotype suggests a strong interaction between
Gata4 - and Erk-dependent pathways. Collectively, these data are consistent with a model in
which Gata4  functions upstream of an Erbb3-Ras-Erk  pathway that is necessary for the
formation of cushion mesenchyme. Intriguingly, Gata4  itself is activated by Erk
phosphorylation (Liang et al., 2001), suggesting the possibility of a positive-feedback loop that
promotes endocardial EMT.
Although Gata4  is required for AV EMT, Gata4 interaction with Fog is dispensable for this
step of AV valve development. Embryos deficient in Fog1  or Fog2 , or in Gata4-Fog
interactions ( Gata4Ki/Ki), did not show any defect in the generation of AV valve mesenchyme
by EMT (Crispino et al., 2001; Katz et al., 2003; Tevosian et al., 2000), indicating that Gata4
regulation of AV cushion EMT does not require Fog interaction. Consistent with this
conclusion, Gata4T2del/Ki EC were normally populated with mesenchymal cells (Fig. 8A–D).
Gata4 function in AV valve growth and remodeling
After AV cushion mesenchyme is formed by EMT, it rapidly proliferates to fill the expanding
AV cushions with mesenchymal cells. The growing superior and inferior AV cushions meet
and fuse, dividing the ventricular inlet into a right and left channel. Gata4  is necessary for this
process, as a decrease in Gata4  levels or germline abrogation of the Gata4-Fog  interaction
resulted in an unseptated ventricular inlet (Crispino et al., 2001; Pu et al., 2004). Here, we show
that Gata4-Fog interaction within endothelial-derived cells is required for septation of the
ventricular inlet (Fig. 8).
Conclusion
This study demonstrates an essential role for expression of Gata4  in the endothelium and its
derivatives. During the initial steps of AV valve formation, Gata4  is necessary for the
expression of Erbb3 , which acts through a Ras-Erk  pathway to promote EMT. During
subsequent steps of AV valve maturation, Gata4, in cooperation with a Fog cofactor, promotes
the growth and fusion of the AV cushions, resulting in the division of the ventricular inlet into
two separate channels guarded by two AV valves. These data suggest that Gata4  mutationsRivera-Feliciano et al. Page 9

might contribute to EC defects in humans; indeed, a Gata4  mutation has been reported to occur
in association with AV septal defects (Garg et al., 2003).

essential for EMT. The liver (L) was normal in size and morphology. Boxed regions of A,B
are enlarged in C,D. ( E,F) A common atrioventricular canal (asterisk) was present in all
Gata4T2del/Ki embryos at E14.5, whereas in control embryos the AVC was septated by the
fusion of the superior and inferior cushions. ( G) Decreased proliferation of cushion
mesenchyme in Gata4T2del/Ki embryos. Proliferation was measured as the percentage of nuclei
that stained positive for BrdU (red). Nuclei were stained with DAPI. Myocyctes were labeled
with desmin (green). Three sections from three different E12.5 embryos were examined per
group by a blinded observer (* P<0.05).Rivera-Feliciano et al. Page 23
