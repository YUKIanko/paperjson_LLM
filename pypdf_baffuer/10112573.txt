The role of GATA4 during the earliest stages of cardiogenesis has
not been deﬁned because Gata4 knockout embryos suffer an early
developmental arrest caused by deﬁciencies in extraembryonicvisceral endoderm function. We have used tetraploid embryocomplementation to rescue these defects and generated clonalembryonic day 9.5 Gata4
/H11546//H11546embryos directly from embryonic stem
cells. GATA4-null embryos display heart defects characterized bydisrupted looping morphogenesis, septation, and a hypoplasticventricular myocardium. We ﬁnd that myocardial gene expressionis relatively normal in GATA4-null hearts including expression ofGATA6. Moreover, GATA4 expression in the endocardium is dis-pensable for trabeculae formation. Remarkably, the proepicardiumis absent in GATA4-null embryos, blocking formation of the epi-cardium. Therefore, we propose that the observed myocardialdefects may be a secondary consequence of loss of the proepicar-dium. These ﬁndings deﬁnitively demonstrate a requirement forGATA4 during early cardiac development and identify an essentialfactor for generation of the proepicardium.

proepicardial organ
In the mouse, the cardiac lineage is specified from cells of the
primitive streak at approximately embryonic day (E) 7.0. The
nascent cardiac mesoderm migrates anterolaterally, where itfuses at the ventral aspect of the embryo to form a linear hearttube by E8.5. The linear tube subsequently undergoes complexlooping and septation to form the characteristic four-chamberedheart. Considerable effort has been made in defining the mo-lecular networks controlling mammalian heart development, inpart because this knowledge is applicable to human diseasestates such as congenital heart disease and cardiac hypertrophy.Central to these processes, cardiac-selective transcription factorssuch as MEF2c, NKX2–5, TBX5, and HAND1 have been shownto activate cardiac gene expression and are essential for theproper patterning of the developing heart (1, 2).
The zinc finger transcription factor GATA4 represents an-
other such factor. It is expressed in the lateral plate mesodermat the earliest stages of cardiac differentiation and subsequentlymaintained in the cardiac lineage throughout development (3).GATA4 regulates cardiac specific gene expression in vitro (4–6)
and modulates cardiogenesis in Xenopus and in embryonic stem
(ES) cell embryoid bodies (7, 8). In mice, an engineered pointmutation in GATA4, predicted to disrupt the interaction withthe cofactor friend-of-GATA 2 (FOG2), results in septation andcoronary vasculature defects evident by E12.5 (9), a phenotypesimilar to two pedigrees of human congenital heart defectslinked to mutations in GATA4 (10).
Despite these studies, the targeted disruption of GATA4 has
failed to resolve a function for this factor at the earliest stages ofheart development. GATA4-null embryos arrest at approxi-mately E8.0 because of defects in ventral morphogenesis, in-cluding a failure of the cardiac mesoderm to form a linear hearttube (11, 12). However, these defects could be rescued byproviding GATA4-null embryos with wild-type visceralendoderm, demonstrating that this phenotype is caused by adefect in extraembryonic tissue and not the heart, per se (13).Defects in the development of extraembryonic endoderm can be
circumvented by producing embryos from ES cells by usingtetraploid embryo complementation (14). Fetuses generated bythis procedure are derived solely from ES cells, whereas theextraembryonic endoderm is tetraploid embryo-derived (15).We have used this procedure to generate Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos.
These embryos display defects in cardiogenesis and proepicar-dium development, demonstrating an essential function forGATA4 in the patterning of the ventral mesoderm.
Materials and Methods
Generation of Plasmids, Gata4/H11546//H11546ES Cells, and Embryos. Targeting
and Cre excision of the Gata4 locus was performed as described
(16). A targeting vector pGATA4loxPDT was constructed tocontain a neo-tkcassette flanked by two loxP sites from plasmid
pHR-1 that were inserted into the first Sma I site upstream of
Gata4 exon 3. A single loxP site was introduced into the Bam HI
site between exons 5 and 6. Negative selection was provided bythe diptheria toxin gene. Methodologies for the generation of EScell-derived embryos by tetraploid embryo complementationhave been described elsewhere (14). Pregnant mare serumgonadotropin (PMSG) used in superovulation was obtainedfrom A. F. Parlow at the National Hormone and PeptideProgram (Torrance, CA). Gata4
loxP//H11001;Tie2Cre mice were gener-
ated by breeding Gata4loxP//H11001mice ( Gata4tm1Sad) with Tie2-Cre
mice (17).
Histochemistry, Immunohistochemistry, and Electron Microscopy
(EM). Immunohistochemistry was performed by using antigen
retrieval as described elsewhere (16) by using antibodies againstGATA4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), sarcomeric myosin(MF20, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City,
IA), Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1) (Cell Marque, Hot Springs, AR),and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (CD31, BDPharmingen). For EM, tissues were fixed in 2% gluteraldehydein cacodylate buffer and embedded in epoxy resin. Semithin(2-
/H9262m) sections were stained with toluidine blue, and 80- to
100-nm sections were contrasted with uranyl acetate and leadcitrate for EM.
RT-PCR. RT–PCR was carried out as described (14). Primer
sequences are provided in Supporting Text , which is published as
supporting information on the PNAS web site.
Results and Discussion
We used a two-step Cre-lox P strategy to delete exons 3–5 of the
Gata4 gene in ES cells (Fig. 1 A). These exons contain both zinc
finger DNA-binding domains and the nuclear localization signalthat are essential for GATA4 function (12). Both genomic copiesofGata4 were targeted sequentially to produce Gata4

cells whose genotype was confirmed by Southern blot (Fig. 1 B).
ES cells harboring a single Gata4 ‘‘floxed ’’allele were also
produced and used to generate a line of mice whose deletion of
Gata4 depended on the presence of Cre recombinase. In agree-
ment with previous studies (18), Gata4/H11002//H11002ES cells were unable
to differentiate into visceral endoderm in vitro confirming thatthey are functionally null for GATA4 (Fig. 6, which is published
as supporting information on the PNAS web site ). To addressthe role of GATA4 in cardiogenesis, we generated embryos fromGata4
/H11001//H11002and Gata4/H11002//H11002ES cells by aggregating them with
wild-type tetraploid embryos. As has been shown (13), Gata4/H11002//H11002
embryos complemented with wild-type visceral endoderm sur-
vive to E9.5, rescuing the developmental defects, includingcardia bifida , associated with conventionally produced Gata4
knockout embryos (Fig. 1 Cand D). Southern blot analyses
demonstrated that these embryos were genetically identical totheGata4
/H11002//H11002ES cells (Fig. 7, which is published as supporting
information on the PNAS web site), and immunostaining ex-periments confirmed that they contained no functional GATA4protein (Fig. 1 Eand F). Control Gata4
/H11001//H11002ES cell-derived
embryos were indistinguishable from wild-type embryos andwere viable until at least E12. By comparison, Gata4
/H11002//H11002ES
cell-derived embryos arrested between E9.5 and E10 (data notshown). It is worth noting that embryos harboring a mutationaffecting the interaction of GATA4 with friend-of-GATA 2(FOG2) survived until E12.5 (9). The earlier embryonic lethalityof GATA4-null embryos, therefore, demonstrates a FOG2-independent function for GATA4 during development.
To determine the cause of the developmental arrest, we
compared somite-matched Gata4
/H11001//H11002and Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos
ranging from 18 to 22 somites. The mutant phenotype reportedbelow was confirmed in embryos from two independentGata4
/H11002//H11002ES cell lines. The most striking anatomical abnormal-
ity associated with Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos was a failure of the heart
tube to undergo correct looping morphogenesis, characterizedby the atrial /H20862inflow tract region failing to migrate rostrally (Fig.
2A–D). In addition, the atrioventricular canal and bulboven-
tricular groove, structures representing early events in chamberformation, are absent (Fig. 2 A–D). These defects are evident on
sections of Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos as a dilated heart tube that has
failed to form distinct chambers (Fig. 2 E–H). Histology also
reveals that the inflow tract region, which bifurcates at the levelof the liver bud into the left and right sinus venosus in Gata4
/H11001//H11002
embryos, is present as a single vessel in Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos (Fig.
2Iand J). Interestingly, vitamin A-deficient (VAD) quail
embryos display a similar fused inflow tract (19). However,unlike the VAD model, GATA4-null embryos do not appear tohave a blind-ended heart tube (data not shown). The failure ofGATA4-null hearts to initiate chamber formation is particularlyprovocative given the recent finding that septation defects areassociated with GATA4 mutations in human congenital heartdisease (10).
Close examination of sections through Gata4
/H11002//H11002hearts re-
vealed a thinning of the myocardium in the presumptive ven-tricular region compared to control hearts (Fig. 2 E–H). In
addition, there was no evidence that the endocardial cushionshad formed in the null embryos, although they were readilydetectable in the controls. Immunohistochemical staining forsarcomeric myosin was performed to define whether there wasa defect in the generation of the myocardium in the absence ofGATA4. In Gata4
/H11001//H11002hearts (Fig. 3 A), the ventricular region is
characterized by the presence of cardiomyocyte projections,called trabeculae, that extend into the lumen of the heart tube.In contrast, the degree of ventricular trabeculation in Gata4
/H11002//H11002
hearts is drastically reduced (Fig. 3 B). The cellular architecture
of these regions was examined in toluidine blue-stained semithinsections (Fig. 3 Cand D). The ventricular cardiomyocytes of
Gata4
/H11001//H11002hearts form a well defined, tightly packed outer (future
subepicardial) cell layer and a distinctive trabecular organizationto the inner surface (Fig. 3 C). The individual cardiomyocytes
have a globular morphology with prominent nuclei. In Gata4
/H11002//H11002
hearts, the ventricular cardiomyocytes have an elongated ap-
pearance with clear intercellular gaps. Consequently, there is lessintegrity to the outer surface of the myocardium (Fig. 3 D). Based

on the disrupted cytoarchitecture and reduced trabeculation of
Gata4/H11002//H11002hearts, we believe that a deficit in cardiac output is the
most likely cause of lethality of Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos. Defects in
trabeculation are a feature of other mouse mutants, includingNkx2–5 ,Raldh2 , and Mef2c , which result in developmental arrest
between E9.5 and E10.5 (20 –22). This may reflect the role of
trabeculae in adding contractile power to the ventricles at thisstage in development (23).
The flattened morphology of GATA4-null cardiomyocytes is
suggestive of a more differentiated phenotype. We thereforeexamined the extent of differentiation in the future subepicardialcardiomyocytes by using electron microscopy. We were able todetect bundles of myofibrils and associated Zlines, structures
indicative of sarcomere assembly in control and Gata4
/H11002//H11002car-
diomyocytes, indicating that differentiation had occurred in both(Fig. 3 EandF). However, these structures were more predom-
inant in Gata4
/H11002//H11002cardiomyocytes, suggesting that differentia-
tion may be more advanced in these cells. Intercalated disks,intercellular junctions connecting adjacent cardiomyocytes,could also be identified in both control and mutant embryos(Fig. 3 Eand F).
Although GATA4 has been shown to regulate cardiac gene
expression, our finding that cardiomyocyte differentiation maybe enhanced in Gata4
/H11002//H11002hearts seemed to contradict this.
Therefore, we examined the consequence of loss of GATA4 onmyocardial gene expression. The steady-state levels of 17 char-acteristic cardiomyocyte mRNAs were compared between wild-type and Gata4
/H11002//H11002hearts by RT-PCR. Fig. 3 Gshows that no
overt disruption of gene expression was associated with loss ofGATA4, even though several of these genes have been shown tocontain GATA4-responsive regulatory elements (4, 24). Inaddition, expression of Raldh2 (Aldh1a2R ) and Vcam , mutations
in which defects in trabeculae formation occur at later devel-opmental stages, was normal, as was expression of the GATA-binding proteins Fog1 (Zfpm1 ) and Fog2 (Zfpm2 ) (Fig. 8, which
is published as supporting information on the PNAS web site).Interestingly, mRNA levels of some genes appeared to beslightly, but reproducibly, increased in Gata4
/H11002//H11002hearts, includ-
ingGata5, Gata6 ,Nppa ,Myh6 ,Myl2 ,Acta1 , and Acta2 (Fig. 3 G).
The relatively benign affect that loss of GATA4 function has oncardiac gene expression may be a consequence of redundancybetween GATA factors. GATA6 has been implicated in rescuing
GATA4 function in other gene disruption studies (11, 12, 25),raising the possibility that the observed increase in Gata5 /H208626
expression (Fig. 3 G) may be sufficient to compensate for loss of
GATA4 function.
The absence of changes in GATA-target gene expression in
Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos suggests that the observed disruption to
myocardial development is non-cell autonomous. Indeed, chi-
mera analysis has shown that GATA4-null cardiomyocytes couldcontribute to a functional myocardium up to at least E18 (25).In addition to the cardiomyocytes, GATA4 is expressed in twotissues that influence myocardial differentiation, the endocar-dium and proepicardium (Figs. 1 Eand 4 C). Therefore, we
examined the development of these tissues to determine whetherthey may be contributing to the observed cardiogenic defects.
The endocardium develops from the precardiac mesoderm in
parallel with the myocardium, forming an endothelial cell layerwhich lines the inside of the primitive heart tube (26). Later indevelopment, the endocardium, through a process dependent oninteraction with the myocardium, contributes to the formation ofthe valvuloseptal tissues via intermediate cardiac cushion tissue(27, 28). In Fig. 3 Hand I, immunohistochemical staining for
platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule clearly identifiesendocardial formation in the ventricular region of Gata4
/H11001//H11002and
Gata4/H11002//H11002hearts. As trabeculae form, the endocardium infiltrates
the myocardium to line these structures (20). This network ofendothelial cells can be seen in the ventricular region of trans-verse sections of Gata4
/H11001//H11002hearts (Figs. 3 Hand 4 C). However,
in the Gata4/H11002//H11002hearts, the structure of the endocardial network
is less elaborate, with clear gaps observed between the myocar-dium and endocardium (Fig. 3 I). The cellular origin of this defect
is unclear. Deletion of Nkx2 –5, which is expressed only in the
myocardium, results in a similar phenotype (20). Consequently,this defect was attributed to the attenuated development of themyocardium rather than a specific defect in endocardial devel-opment because reduced contact between the myocardium andendocardium is a feature of a more primitive pretrabecularventricle (29). In support of this interpretation for Gata4
/H11002//H11002
hearts, ultrastructural analysis found no differences between
cells of control and mutant endocardium (data not shown).Disruption of Nrg1 , which is expressed in the endocardium, or its

receptors ErbB2 or ErbB4 results in a disruption to development
of trabeculae (30 –32). To test directly whether GATA4 expres-
sion in the endocardium was required for trabeculae formation,we produced embryos in which Gata4 was disrupted specifically
in the endocardium by generating Gata4
loxP/loxP;Tie2Cre mice. At
E10.5, all embryos, regardless of the presence or absence of
GATA4 in the endocardium, formed trabeculae (Fig. 4). More-over, RT-PCR analyses of Gata4
/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos
identified no difference from controls in the steady-state mRNAlevels encoding Nrg1 ,ErbB2 ,ErbB3 ,o rErbB4 , or in expression
ofTie2,VegfA ,VegfB ,VegfRI ,VegfRII , and Flt1 (Fig. 8).
GATA4 is also robustly expressed in the proepicardium (Fig.
1E), which is an outgrowth of the anterior surface of the septum
transversum mesenchyme (STM) that migrates over the surfaceof the heart to form the epicardium. Cells in this epicardial layerare subsequently capable of migrating into the myocardium,where they form cardiac fibroblasts and the smooth muscle andendothelium of the coronary vessels (33). Studies in chickenshave clearly described the morphogenetic movements made bycells of the proepicardium and have identified the cell lineagesto which the proepicardium gives rise (33). However, the mo-lecular mechanisms that control proepicardium development arevirtually unknown, which is surprising given that cells derivedfrom the proepicardium have been shown to directly impact
myocardial differentiation including valvuloseptal development(34–36). The tumor suppressor WT1 protein is one of the few
characterized markers of the proepicardium, so we used it totrace development of this tissue in GATA4-null embryos (37).As shown in Fig. 5 A, the proepicardium can be identified as a
cluster of WT1-positive cells migrating between the atrial andventricular regions of the myocardium. In contrast to controlembryos, sections through the entire heart tube of Gata4
/H11002//H11002
embryos showed no indication of any WT1-positive cells in
contact with the myocardium (Fig. 5 B). Caudal to the heart in
Gata4/H11001//H11002embryos, WT1-positive STM, the source of the pro-
epicardium, is located ventrally between the bifurcated arms ofthe sinus venosus (Fig. 5 C). At an equivalent level in Gata4
/H11002//H11002
embryos, the sinus venosus exists as a single vessel with no
WT1-positive mesenchyme present ventral to this structure.There does exist a small outgrowth of WT1-positive mesen-chyme continuous with the peritoneum in a more lateral posi-tion, which may represent a remnant of the STM (Fig. 5 D). In
an effort to determine which were primary versus secondaryeffects, we compared the heart tubes of Gata4
/H11001//H11002andGata4/H11002//H11002

GATA4-null embryos, consistent with a caudal displacement of
the atrial region (data not shown). Otherwise, the myocardiumwas indistinguishable from Gata4
/H11001//H11002control embryos (Fig. 9,
which is published as supporting information on the PNAS website). At this same stage in development, the STM can beidentified in control embryos, but, as is the case at laterdevelopmental stages, it is undetectable in Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos
(Fig. 9). These data identify GATA4 as a transcription factor thatis essential for the genesis of the proepicardium and for correctSTM development. It is noteworthy that, as in cardiomyocytes,GATA6 is also expressed in the STM and proepicardium (datanot shown). However, in contrast to cardiomyocytes, the com-plete absence of the proepicardium in Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos dem-
onstrates that the role of GATA4 in the formation of this tissueis indispensable and cannot be compensated by GATA6. These
data are supported by defects in the proepicardium derivedcoronary vasculature of E12.5 embryos with a point mutation inGATA4 (9).
Although we cannot, at this time, rule out a cell-autonomous
requirement for GATA4 in the myocardium, we propose thatthe absence of the STM and the proepicardium is a primarycause of the cardiac phenotype associated with loss of GATA4.This proposal seems particularly plausible given the spatialassociation between the heart, STM, and proepicardium dur-ing development and the specific myocardial defects observedinGata4
/H11002//H11002embryos. The STM and, by association, proepi-
cardium are derived from splanchnic mesoderm, and devel-opment of these tissues is closely associated with the cardiacmesoderm (38). By E9.5, the STM and proepicardium arepositioned immediately caudal to the atrioventricular region of
the heart, bisecting the sinus venosus (Fig. 5 E). The absence
of the STM /H20862proepicardium may, therefore, disrupt the devel-
opment of the atrioventricular region and the bifurcation ofthe sinus venosus, as is observed in Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos (Fig.
5E). Our data support a role for the STM /H20862proepicardium in
myocardial development from E8.5. Although no data exist forthe role of the STM /H20862proepicardium in myocardial develop-
ment at such an early developmental stage, several studieshave identified a role for the epicardium in myocardial devel-opment at later stages. In quail embryos, ablation of theproepicardium at the Hamburger /H20862Hamilton (HH) 15 stage
(E9.5 in mouse) results in myocardial defects, including a thincompact zone and aberrant septation, which are manifest atHH29 (E13.5 in mouse) (39). Similar myocardial defects areobserved when migration of the proepicardium to the myo-cardium is impaired in gene knockout studies that block theinteraction between vascular endothelial adhesion molecule 1and
/H92514-integrin (40 –42). Recent analyses have also begun to
address the molecular basis of epicardial function in myocar-dial development. Retinoic acid (RA) and erythropoietin(Epo), produced by the epicardium, are thought to act asautocrine signals mediating the secretion of trophic factorsthat influence myocardial development (34 –36). Interestingly,
reduced trabeculation, enhanced cardiomyocyte differentia-tion, and defective outflow tract separation, as seen inGata4
/H11002//H11002embryos, are features of RA deficiency and inacti-
vation of genes in the RA signaling pathway (43). Althoughnone of the above studies explicitly address the development
Fig. 4. Expression of GATA4 in the endocardium is dispensable for trabecular
formation at E10.5. Embryos were generated that lack GATA4 speci ﬁcally in
the endocardium by breeding Gata4loxP/loxPmice to Gata4loxP//H11001;Tie2Cre mice.
Immunostaining using an anti-GATA4 antibody identi ﬁed GATA4 in the nuclei
of both the myocardium (white arrow) and endocardium (black arrow) incontrol Gata4
loxP//H11001;Tie2Cre embryos ( AandC) at E10.5. In contrast, GATA4 is
detected only in the myocardium and is absent from the endocardium ofGata4
loxP/loxP;Tie2Cre embryos ( Band D). Boxes in Aand Brepresent high-
magni ﬁcation images shown in Cand D.(Eand F) Hematoxylin and eosin-
stained nearby sections identify trabeculae (line) regardless of the presence ( E)
or absence ( F) of GATA4 in the endocardium.
Fig. 5. Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos lack a proepicardium. ( A–D) Micrographs show
WT1 staining of Gata4/H11001//H11002(Aand C) and Gata4/H11002//H11002(Band D) embryos. WT1
staining identi ﬁes the proepicardium as an outgrowth of the STM between
atrial (a) and ventricular (v) regions in Gata4/H11001//H11002embryos ( A; white arrow) that
is absent in Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos ( B; black arrow). The parietal pericardium stains
positively for WT1 in both Gata4/H11001//H11002and Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos ( Aand B; black
arrowhead). At the level of the liver bud ( CandD; asterisk), WT1-positive cells
are present ventral to the sinus venosus (sv) in Gata4/H11001//H11002embryos ( C; white
arrow). In contrast, mutant embryos only have WT1-positive cells in an irreg-ular outgrowth of the peritoneum lateral to the single lumen of the sinusvenosus ( D; white arrow). ( E) Schematic representation of GATA4 mutant
phenotype. In Gata4
/H11001//H11002embryos the STM (st) is positioned immediately caudal
to the heart. The absence of STM in Gata4/H11002//H11002embryos results in a displaced

of the endocardium, embryos null for the RA metabolizing
enzyme RALDH2 appear to have a less developed endocar-dium, similar to Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos (22). The STM /H20862
proepicardium also expresses a number of growth factors,including bone morphogenetic proteins, implicated in heartdevelopment (26, 44), and is essential for the outgrowth of thehepatic primordia, highlighting the role of this tissue as aninductive mesenchyme (45).
In summary, we have uncovered a role for GATA4 in the
generation of the STM and the related proepicardium, therebyidentifying GATA4 as the only known factor to be essential for thegenesis of this inductive tissue. We postulate that, because of
redundancy between GATA factors, the additional cardiogenicdefects are likely caused by the absence of the proepicardium ratherthan a cell-autonomous defect in the myocardium. This model mayalso suggest a nonmyocardial component to the human congenitalheart defects associated with mutations in GATA4.
