Abstract. The GATA family of zinc finger proteins are transcrip-
tional regulators with critical functions in lineage differentiation
and embryonic development. Based on structural and expression
pattern comparisons, the GATA proteins have been subdivided
into two groups. The first subgroup consists of GATA-1, -2, and
-3, which are all highly expressed in the hematopoietic system,
whereas GATA-4, -5, and -6 are present essentially in the heart
and gut. We have isolated and functionally characterized the rat
GATA-5 cDNA, which encodes a 45-kDa protein with 71%, 73%,
and 97% homology to its amphibian, avian, and murine homologs,
respectively. Northern blot analysis showed that rat GATA-5 is
expressed in a dynamic pattern during embryonic and postnatal
development.Inthemidgestationembryo,GATA-5transcriptsare
most abundant in the heart and decrease dramatically in the post-
natal heart; in contrast, GATA-5 expression is upregulated in the
lung and gut during postnatal development. Functional studies
withrecombinantGATA-4,-5,and-6proteinsshowthatGATA-5
has preferential affinity for a subset of GATA elements found on
cardiac promoters and differentially activate cardiac gene tran-
scription. Structure-function analysis revealed the presence of an
activation domain within the carboxy terminal region of GATA-5
that is essential for transcriptional regulation of target promoters.
Linkage analysis localized Gata5to distal mouse Chromosome
(Chr) 2 in a conserved linkage group with genes localized to rat
Chr 3q43 and human Chr 20q13.2-q13.3. The results suggest that
GATA-5mayhavespecificdownstreamtargetsandthatGATA-4,
-5, and -6 can only partially substitute for each other in cardio-
genesis. Thus, Gata5probably plays a specialized evolutionary
conserved role in cardiac development.
Introduction
GATA proteins are lineage-restricted zinc finger transcription fac-
tors that play critical roles during cellular growth and differentia-
tion. Indeed, the three GATA factors that are expressed in hema-
topoietic derived cells are required for embryonic development
and have nonredundant essential functions for normal hematopoi-
esis (Pandolfi et al. 1995; Tsai et al. 1994). GATA-1, the founding
member of the family, is expressed in all erythroid precursors, and
targeted disruption of its gene arrests erythropoiesis at the pro-
erythroblast stage both in vivo and in vitro (Pevny et al. 1995;
Weiss et al. 1994). Similarly, inactivation of the GATA-2 gene,
whose expression is very high in hematopoietic stem cells, inter-
feres with normal hematopoiesis by inhibiting expansion of hema-
topoietic progenitor cells (Tsai et al. 1994). Hematopoiesis is also
impaired in the absence of GATA-3 (Pandolfi et al. 1995).Three other GATA factors, GATA-4, -5, and -6, were recently
identified (Gre ´pin et al. 1994; Jiang and Evans 1996; Kelley et al.
1993; Laverriere et al. 1994). Based on sequence homologies and
tissue distribution—mainly in the heart and gut—it has been sug-
gestedthatGATA-4,-5,and-6formasubfamilyofGATAfactors
that may have important roles during cardiogenesis. The expres-
sion pattern of all three genes in the developing heart and the
functionalanalysisofGATA-4supportthishypothesis.Thus,both
in amphibians and in mammals, GATA-4 transcripts are detected
in precardiac cells and persist throughout the embryonic and post-
natal heart (Gre ´pin et al. 1994; Heikinheimo et al. 1994; Jiang and
Evans 1996). In Xenopus, axis disruption experiments show that
GATA-4 transcription correlates with specification of cardiac pro-
genitors (Jiang and Evans 1996), and in adults, GATA-4 expres-
sion is restricted to the heart and gonads (Gre ´pin et al. 1994;
Laverriere et al. 1994). Consistent with a role for GATA-4 in
myocardialdifferentiation,cardiac-specifictranscriptionofseveral
cardiac marker genes requires conserved GATA binding sites, and
recombinant GATA-4 is a potent transactivator of their promoters
(Gre ´pin et al. 1994; Ip et al. 1994; Molkentin et al. 1994). In an in
vitro stem cell model, GATA-4 transcription correlates spatially
and temporally with cardiac differentiation, and inhibition of
GATA-4 expression blocks formation of terminally differentiated
beating myocytes, while ectopic expression of GATA-4 potenti-
ates cardiogenesis, suggesting a role for GATA-4 in development
of the cardiogenic lineage (Gre ´pin et al. 1995, 1997). Consistent
with this, inactivation of the Gata4gene in mice resulted in em-
bryonic lethality owing to failure of the embryos to form a primi-
tive heart tube (Molkentin et al. 1997).
The expression pattern of GATA-4 in the myocardium of the
developing heart overlaps with that of GATA-6, although it re-
mains uncertain whether both factors colocalize or whether they
are differentially expressed in distinct cell populations (Jiang and
Evans 1996; Tamura et al. 1993). GATA-6 is also more broadly
expressed than GATA-4, most notably in stomach and small in-
testineofbirds,amphibians,andmammals(JiangandEvans1996;
Laverriere et al. 1994; Tamura et al. 1993). While the Gata5gene
is also transcribed in the precardiac mesoderm of birds and am-
phibians (Jiang and Evans 1996; Laverriere et al. 1994), its ex-
pression pattern is different from that of Gata4and6as it is less
abundant in the dorsal precardiac lateral plate and is detected in
more posterior regions of the ventral midline (Jiang and Evans
1996). Moreover, unlike GATA-4 and GATA-6, expression of
GATA-5 is found predominantly in the endocardium of the em-
bryonic heart of both species, raising the possibility that GATA-5
might play a specific role in endocardial development.

characterization,andthechromosomallocalizationof Gata5inthe

evolutionarily conserved from amphibians to mammals and that
GATA-5 has higher affinity than the other cardiac GATA proteins
to some GATA elements; consequently, some GATA-dependent
cardiac promoters—such as endothelin 1 (ET-1)—are preferential
GATA-5 targets. These results suggest a distinct role for GATA-5
in differentiation of the cardiogenic lineage.
Materials and methods
Cloning and DNA sequencing. Total RNA was extracted by the gua-
nidinium–thiocyanate–phenol/chloroform method (Gre ´pin et al. 1994)
from hearts of 3-day-old Sprague Dawley rats. cDNA was synthesized
from 5 /H9262g total RNA with dT12–18adaptor primer and the avian myelo-
blastosis virus reverse transcriptase enzyme(AMV-RT). The cDNA was
amplified with two degenerate oligonucleotides in the sense: TA(CT)
CA(CT) AA(AG) ATG AA(CT) GG and antisense orientation: CG(AG)
TG(AGCT)A(AG)(CT)TTCAT(AH)TAbasedonthesequenceofXeno-
pus and chicken GATA-5, which amplifies a 177-bp fragment. The PCR
productwasclonedinBluescriptvector(pKS)/ EcoRVandsequencedwith
universal and reverse primers. Two specific sense and antisense primers
were synthesized according to the sequence read, and PCR was carried in
the same manner as above with, on the one hand, a sense primer and an
antisense oligonucleotide corresponding to the region spanning the stopcodon (TAGGCCAGGGCCAGGGCACACCAG), and, on the other hand,
a sense oligonucleotide corresponding to the region around the start codon
(ATGTATCAGGGTCTGGCTC), and a specific GATA-5 antisence
primer. The two fragments obtained were cloned in pKS/ EcoRV and se-
quenced.
Northern blots and RT-PCR. Total RNAs from different embryonic,
neonates, and adult tissues of Sprague Dawley rats were extracted by the
guanidinium-thiocyanate method. Samples of 20 /H9262g were loaded on form-
aldehyde agarose gels, transferred to Nytran-nylon membranes (Schleicher
& Schuell), and hybridized to a random primed radiolabeled32P-rGATA-5
probe corresponding to the entire coding region. Blots were washed twice
for 15 min at 65°C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and exposed for 4 days at
−70°C. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with the 18S
probe as previously described (Gre ´pin et al., 1994).
For PCR amplification, two oligonucleotides in the sense: GAAC-
CAGTGTGCAACGCCTG and antisense orientation: CTAGGCCAG-
GGCCAGGGCACACCAG were used on cDNA transcribed from the
RNA extracted from different tissues. The PCR products corresponding to
the C-terminal region of GATA-5 (nucleotides 806–1215) were separated
by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hy-
bridizedwiththerandomlyradiolabeledGATA-5DNAprobe(correspond-
ingtotheentirecodingregion),washedfor15minat65°Cwith0.1×SSC,

domains (>90%), whereas the overall sequence homology varies between
58% and 65%.G. Nemer et al.: Cloning and analysis of rat GATA-5 994

rat tubulin transcripts as previously described (Gre ´pin et al. 1997).
Cell culture and transfections. HeLa and CV1 cells were grown in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10%
fetal calf serum. DNA was transfected by the calcium phosphate precipi-
tation technique 24 h after plating. The amount of the reporter expression
vector was kept constant at 3 /H9262g per 35-mm culture dish. The cells were
harvested 36 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured by
an LKB luminometer. The results are the mean of three independent ex-
periments done each in duplicate. The ANP- and BNP-luciferase reporters
were described in Gre ´pin et al. (1994). The GATA-4 and -6 expression
vectors were described in Durocher et al. (1997). The mouse ET-1 lucif-
erase reporter plasmid was a generous gift of Hiroki Kurihara (University
of Tokyo, Japan) and was described in Harats et al. (1995). The GATA-4
and -6 expression vectors were described in Charron et al. (1999) and
GATA-2inLeeetal.(1991).TheGATA-5expressionvectorwasprepared
by subcloning the entire coding region into the pCDNA3 vector ( XhoI/
KpnI). The GATA-5 mutant constructs were obtained by PCR-mediated
mutagenesis and subcloned in the same manner in pCDNA3. The C-
terminaldeletionmutant( /H9004C)consistsofaa1–300,theN-terminal( /H9004N)of
aa 180–405, the single carboxy zinc finger mutant of aa 256–405, and the
double mutant deletion ( /H9004CN) retains only the DNA binding domain of aa
180–300. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
Electrophoretic mobility shift-assays (EMSA). CV1 cells devoid of
GATA-binding activity were transfected with the rat GATA-5 expression
vector. 500,000 cells were plated 24 h before transfection with 50 /H9262go f
GATA-2, GATA-4, GATA-5, or GATA-5 mutant expression vectors.
Nuclear extracts were prepared as previously described (Gre ´pin et al.
1994).Double-strandedoligonucleotidescorrespondingeithertotheproxi-
mal GATA site of the ANF promoter (Durocher et al. 1997) or the ET-1
GATA element (Harats et al. 1995) were used. Five /H9262g of extracts was
incubated with the radiolabeled probe for 15 min at room temperature in a
20-ml volume of 4 m MTris-HCl(pH /H115058), 24 m MEDTA, 0.4 m MMgCl,
and 1.6% Ficoll and, where necessary, 100-fold excess of cold unlabeled
probes. The samples were loaded on a 4% electrophoresis polyacrylamide

Genetic mapping of the mouse Gata-5 gene. To establish the chro-
mosomal location of murine Gata5,we performed a linkage analysis with
The Jackson Laboratory Backcross DNA BSB panel (C57BL/6J × Mus
spretus)F1× C57BL/6J. Genomic DNA of 94 backcross progeny was
digested with XbaI, electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto a
nylon membrane under standard protocols. Blots were hybridized with a
409-bp32P-dATP random primer-labeled probe corresponding to nucleo-
tides 807–1215 of the rat Gata-5 cDNA. Hybridization was carried out at
42°C in 50% formamide, 10% dextran sulfate, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate
(SDS), 5× SSC (0.75 MNaCl, 75 m MNa citrate), 2 m MTris (pH 7.5), 1×
Denhardt’ssolution(0.1%BSA,0.1%Ficoll,0.1%polyvinylpyrrolidone),
and 200 /H9262g/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Washing was carried out to
a final stringency of 0.5 × SSC/1.0% SDS at 60°C. Autoradiography was
done at −70°C using Kodak XAR film with the intensification screens;
films were developed after exposure for 24–48 h. Detailed mapping data
are available at Backcross Panel Mapping Resonace page (http://

Results
The GATA-5 protein is conserved between species. Five GATA
proteins have been identified so far in mammals: GATA-1,
GATA-2, and GATA-3, which are highly restricted to the hema-
topoietic system, and GATA-4 and -6, which are confined to theheart, the digestive system, and the gonads. The cloning in Xeno-
pus (Jiang and Evans 1996) and in chicken (Laverriere et al. 1994)
of GATA-5, the sixth member of the family, whose expression,
much like GATA-4 and GATA-6, is restricted to heart and gut,
suggested the existence of a subclass of GATA factors that might
play important roles in heart and gut development. In order to
analyze the evolutionary conservation of GATA-5 and study its
role in mammalian heart, we isolated the rat GATA-5 cDNA.
Degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to the highly con-
served region of the second zinc finger region of the Xenopus and
chickenGATA-5weresynthesized,andpolymerasechainreaction
(PCR) was carried on cDNA transcribed from RNA of hearts of
3-day-old Sprague Dawley rats. A fragment of 177 bp was cloned
in Bluescript vector (pKS): the deduced sequence showed high
homology with the corresponding region of the Xenopus and
chicken GATA-5 (>98%), compared with 94% and 93% for the
same region of rat GATA-4 and rat GATA-6. Two oligonucleo-
tides synthesized according to the sequence read in antisense and
sense orientation were used for PCR with two degenerate oligo-
nucleotides corresponding respectively to the start codon (sense
orientation) and stop codon (antisense orientation) regions. Two
fragments of 806 and 409 bp were cloned in pKS and sequenced.
An additional PCR was performed on the two fragments to gen-
eratea1215-bpcDNAcorrespondingtotheentirecodingregionof
GATA-5 encoding a protein of 405 amino acids with a predicted
molecularweightof45kDa.Computer-assistedsequenceanalyses
showed that the rat GATA-5 protein is highly homologous to its
chicken (73%), Xenopus (71%), and the recently identified mouse
(97%) counterparts, as illustrated in Figure 1A; the overall homol-
ogy to the rat GATA-4 and -6 proteins was 60–62%, while theFig. 2.Tissue distribution of the rGATA-5 mRNA. (A)Northern blot

GATA-5 transcripts are expressed at highest levels in the devel-
oping heart. Expression of the rat Gata5gene was analyzed by
Northern blots and RT-PCR. A radiolabeled32P GATA-5 probe
wasusedon20 /H9262goftotalRNAextractedfromdifferenttissuesof
neonate and adult Sprague Dawley rats, as well as embryos at day
14ofgestation.AsshowninFig.2A,auniquebandof ∼2.0kbwas
detected in embryonic hearts and in cardiac and extracardiac post-
natal tissues. As previously reported for xenopus and chicken
(Kelly et al. 1995; Laverriere et al. 1994), expression of GATA-5
in the heart decreased sharply between embryonic and postnatal,
suggesting that GATA-5 is mainly an embryonic cardiac regulator
(notethatthetimeofexposurefortheadultblotis7days,whereas
that of the embryonic blot is 2 days at −70°C).
In order to better detect low abundant GATA-5 transcripts in
postnataltissues,RT-PCRanalysiswascarriedout.A409-bpfrag-
ment corresponding to nucleotides 806–1215 was amplified with
two specific oligonucleotide primers, and the PCR products were
further confirmed by Southern blots with a radiolabeled GATA-5DNA probe. A 546-bp rat tubulin fragment was amplified as in-
ternal control. The results showed that, besides the heart, GATA-5
transcriptsarefoundinstomach,intestine,andlung(Fig.2D).This
is similar to the reported tissue distribution of GATA-5 transcripts
in adult mouse (Morrisey et al. 1997a) and in postnatal avian
(Laverriere et al. 1994) tissues.
Functional properties of the rat GATA-5 protein. In order to per-
form functional analysis of the GATA-5 protein, the cDNA frag-
ment containing the entire coding region was cloned in the eu-
karyotic expression vector (pCDNA3) downstream of the CMV
promoter and transfected into CV1 cells that lack GATA-binding
activity. Nuclear extracts from CV1 cells transfected with this
vector or with the corresponding GATA-4 vector were tested for
binding to the well-characterized GATA element of the ANF
proximal promoter (Charron et al. 1999). As shown in Fig. 3A,
both GATA proteins formed a specific complex over this site.
Because Gata5 expression is predominant in endocardial cells, we
also analyzed the interaction of GATA-5 with the GATA element
of the ET-1 promoter. ET-1 is a peptide hormone with potent
vasoconstrictive activity synthesized in endothelial and endocar-Fig. 3.DNA-binding properties of rGATA-5. Gel
shift analyses were carried out with
32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding
either to the proximal ANF or ET-1 GATA
elements. (A)3/H9262g of nuclear extracts from CV1

oligonucleotide. Arrows indicate specific GATA
binding complexes.G. Nemer et al.: Cloning and analysis of rat GATA-5 996
dial cells; the ET-1 promoter contains a GATA element and was
shown to be transactivated by the endothelial GATA-2 factor (Lee
et al. 1991). When used in EMSAs, the ET-1 GATA displayed
preferential binding to GATA-5 compared with GATA-4 (Fig.
3B), while the ANF GATA element bound equally well both
GATA proteins (Fig. 3A), in accordance with previous studies
(Charronetal.1999).Infact,theET-1GATAelementhadatleast
three times higher affinity for GATA-5 than the ANF GATA site,
as revealed from competition assays (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the
affinity of the ET-1 GATA element was highest for GATA-2 and
-5 (Fig. 3C). The transcriptional properties of GATA-5 were also
assessedbycontransfectionwithreporterconstructsunderthecon-
trol of the ANF, BNP, or ET-1 promoters. The results show that
GATA-5 was as effective as GATA-4 in activating the three
GATA-dependent promoters (Fig. 4). The highest GATA-5 effect
was observed on the ET-1 promoter (20×), which appeared to be
a preferential GATA-5 and GATA-2 target, a result that parallels
thedifferentialaffinitiesofthevariousGATAproteinstotheET-1
GATA site. This raises the possibility that GATA-5 may have
DNA-binding and functional properties that are distinct from the
other GATA factors.
InordertomapthefunctionaldomainsintheGATA-5protein,
we generated four mutant constructs that delete either the N- or
C-terminal domain or both, or a truncated form with only the
carboxy zinc finger and the carboxy terminal region; none of these
mutants alter the nuclear localization signal (NLS). All GATA-5
proteins were hemagglutinin (HA) tagged to allow for immuno-
detection. As shown in Fig. 5B, all GATA-5 proteins were prop-
erly produced from the expression vectors, as assayed by Western
blots with an anti-HA antibody. Both wild-type and mutated pro-
teins interacted specifically with a GATA probe (Fig. 5C). How-
ever, in cotransfection assays, the C-terminal domain appeared
critical for transactivation, as its deletion resulted in a four-fold
decrease in ET-1 promoter activation, both in CV1 and in HeLa
cells (Fig. 5D). In contrast, the N-terminal deletion mutant was as
efficient as the full-length protein in transactivation. Interestingly,
the truncated GATA-5 protein that retained the C-terminal region
and the carboxy zinc finger was able to bind DNA and activate
transcription, suggesting that the N-terminal region and the first
zinc finger are dispensable in some cases (the lower degree of
activation may be due to differences in expression levels, as sug-
gested by Fig. 5B). The pattern of activity of the various GATA-5
mutants was similar when tested on the ANF and BNP promoters
(Fig. 5E). These results map the activation domain for GATA-5 to
the C-terminal region, which may be unique to GATA-5 since the
activation domains for GATA-1, -2, and -3 were found in the
N-terminal region (Visvader et al. 1995), and in the case of
GATA-4,twoC-andN-terminaldomainsweremapped(Durocher
et al. 1997).
Chromosomallocalizationofthemousegata-5gene. Usinga32P-
radiolabeled C-terminal (409-bp) rat cDNA probe, an informative
RFLP was observed after XbaI digestion of genomic DNA ob-
tainedfrominbredmousestrainsusedtocreatethemappingpanel.
Parentalalleleswereidentifiedasspecificbandsat9.5kb(C57BL/
6J) and 6.5 kb ( Mus spretus ). The location of mouse Gata5was
determined by comparing the inheritance of the Mus spretus allele
among 93 backcross progeny with 890 loci previously mapped in
this cross. Gene order was established by minimizing the number
of double recombination events. The results indicate that Gata5
maps to distal Chr 2, cosegregating with three microsatellites,
D2Mit74, D2Ucl18, andD2Ucl29 (Fig. 6). Two recombinants
were detected between Gata5and a cluster of markers including
another microsatellite, D2Ucl1, as well as the Gs protein alpha
stimulatory regulator gene ( Gnas), the phosphoenolpyruvate car-
boxykinase 1 gene ( Pck1), and the synaptobrevin-like 1 pseudo-
gene (Sybl1-ps). Two mouse mutants are known to map to thetelomeric region of Chr 2 in the vicinity of Gata5,ragged (ra) and
wasted (wst) (1). With the exception of edema in ra/rahomozy-
gotes, however, defects involving the cardiac or gastrointestinal
system that would be consistent with a Gata5mutation have not
been described in association with either mutation. The human
orthologue of mouse Gata5is predicted to map to Chr 20q13 (24)
and the rat Gata5gene to Chr 3q43 (http://www.informatics.

Discussion
In this paper, we report the cloning and characterization of rat
GATA-5, a member of the GATA family of transcription factors
expressed in the developing heart. While GATA-4, -5, and -6
transcripts are present in the heart, GATA-5 mRNAs are the least
abundant (5- to 10-fold less than GATA-4), suggesting that only
specific subsets of cells express GATA-5 in the heart. Indeed, in
situ hybridization studies show that, both in Xenopus and rodent,
GATA-5 mRNA is found predominantly in the endocardium as
wellastheoutflow-tract(Kelleyetal.1993;Morriseyetal.1997a;
and our unpublished data). Except for NFATc(de la Pompa et al.
1998), few transcription factors that are implicated in the differ-
entiation of the endocardial endothelial cells are known. Endocar-
dial differenation is accompanied by the expression of specific
genes such as the homeobox gene msx-1(Chan-Thomase et al.
1993; Eisenberg and Markwald 1995; Shen et al. 1994) fibulin,
fibronectin and tenascin-X (Bristow 1995; Eisenberg and Mark-
wald 1995). The presence of conserved GATA motifs in some of
these genes, like msx-1(Shen et al. 1994), tenascin-x (Bristow et
al.1993),andendothelin-1(Wilsonetal.1990),suggestsarolefor
GATA-5 in regulating endocardial genes and thus in cardiac lin-
eage differentiation. Interestingly, some myocardial cells coex-
pressGATA-4andGATA-5intheembryonicheart(G.Nemerand
M. Nemer, unpublished data). Given that GATA-5 is as potent an
activator of cardiac promoters as GATA-4, it may well be able to
substitute—at least in part—for GATA-4 with respect to cardiac
transcription; this may in turn be relevant for understanding theFig.4.TransactivationpropertiesoftherecombinantrGATA-5protein.In

The results are expressed as fold activation relative to cotransfection with
the backbone vector; 25–500 ng of GATA-2, -4, -5, and -6 expression
vectors were used. Similar results were also obtained in HeLa cells. Note

presence of many markers of cardiomyocyte differentiation in the
cardiac crescent of GATA-4 null embryos (Molkentin et al. 1997).
The results presented also revealed that GATA-5 may have pref-
erential downstream targets in cells coexpressing other GATA
factors. Indeed, the ET-1 promoter was more sensitive to GATA-5
than -4 and was induced three times more by similar levels of
GATA-5 and -4 (21 × vs 7 ×), possibly a result of differential
affinity of the two proteins for the ET-1 GATA elements. In con-
trast, the ANF and BNP promoters were activated similarly by the
three cardiac GATA factors. Thus, GATA-4, -5, and -6 could
substitute for each other in activation of some but not all cardiac
genes; this in turn suggests that they could only partially compen-
sate for each other in heart formation.
Interestingly, the major activation domain of GATA-5 mapped
to the C-terminal region. In contrast, the major activation domains
for GATA-1, -2, and -3 were found in N-terminal domain (Vis-
vader et al. 1995), whereas two independent activation domains
were mapped in the C- and N-terminal domains of GATA-4 (Mor-
risey et al. 1997b). In this respect it is noteworthy that the C-
terminal region of GATA-5 proteins is highly conserved across
species, suggesting evolutionary pressure to preserve an important
function.Forexample,a60-aminoacidC-terminaldomainlocated
between aa 366 and 405 is 70% identical among Xenopus,
chicken, and rodent GATA-5. Whether this domain interacts with
other cofactors, such as members of the NK2 family, will be in-
teresting to investigate. Indeed, GATA-5 was shown to cooperate
with the cardiac-specific Nkx2-5 protein, probably through the
C-terminal domain (Durocher et al. 1997). Other members of the
NK2 family are also expressed in similar tissues as GATA-5; this
includes Nkx2-3 and Nkx2-6 which are found in the gut (Biben et
al. 1998; Buchberger et al. 1996), and Nkx2-1, which is expressed
among others in lung (Lazzaro et al. 1991). Thus, it is tempting to
speculate that GATA-5 might play important roles in these tissues
through cooperative interaction with other tissue-specific factors.
Finally, the mouse Gata-5gene maps to Chr 2, whereas theFig. 5.Structure-function analysis of the

carboxy domain (CZn) were used in all
experiments in CV1 and Hela cells with 3 /H9262go f

cotransfection with the backbone vector. (E)
Cotransfection assays in CV1 cells were carried
out with 3 /H9262g of the ANF and BNP reporter genes
and 100 ng of GATA-5 expression. The results are
the mean of three independent experiments, each
in duplicate.

Gata4andGata6genes are localized on mouse Chrs 14 and 18,
respectively (Qureshi et al. 1996; Sebastiani et al. 1995). Thus,
despite extensive sequence homology, these genes appear to have
been duplicated from an ancestral precursor early in evolution.
