The GATA family of nuclear factors has been implicated in the regulation of cell type-speci®c transcription. We report
the isolation of the Xenopus GATA-4 and GATA-6 cDNA clones and characterize the expression patterns of the xGATA-
4/5/6 genes. By comparing the sequence of the cDNAs with those previously reported from chick and mammalian sources,we conclude that each is conserved across vertebrate evolution as a distinct gene product. Each gene is expressed indifferentiated adult heart and gut, but maintains distinct transcript patterns in various other adult tissues. During em-bryogenesis, each gene displays a similar overlapping distribution of transcripts localized throughout the developing cardio-genic region. The xGATA-4 gene can be detected in dorsal cardiac progenitor rudiments prior to migration. Axis disruptionexperiments were used to demonstrate that transcription of these genes is intimately associated with the speci®cation ofcardiac progenitors. Ectopic expression of each gene is speci®cally capable of activating during embryogenesis the transcrip-tion of the cardiac genes encoding actin and myosin heavy chain

RNA Analysis
RNA was prepared from adult frog tissues by homogenization in
RNAzol according to the manufacturer (Cinna Biotecx). ThemRNA was puri®ed using the polyATtract III system (Promega).RNA derived from staged (Nieuwkoop and Faber, 1967) embryoswas extracted by homogenization in 50 m MTris (pH 7.5), 50 mM
NaCl, 5 m MEDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml proteinase K. Sam-
ples were incubated at 377C for 30 min, followed by phenol/chloro-form extraction and ethanol precipitation in the presence of 0.3 M
sodium acetate. RNA was then recovered by precipitating twicewith ethanol in the presence of 2 Mammonium acetate. RT and
PCR reactions were performed as described (Zhang and Evans,1994). To avoid detecting any contaminating genomic DNA, prim-ers were designed to cross intron/exon boundaries. For each reac-tion, the number of cycles was optimized to be certain that thesignal accumulates within a linear range. The speci®city ofxGATA-4/5/6 primers was con®rmed by demonstrating that thePCR products give a predicted pattern upon restriction enzymedigestion. The parameters for xGATA-5, xGATA-6, ®broblast

In general, these expression patterns are quite similar to midline, relative to the other two genes. Also, xGATA-4 and
