In recent years, signiﬁcant progress has been made in understand-
ing cardiomyocyte differentiation. However, little is known aboutthe regulation of myocyte survival despite the fact that myocyteapoptosis is a leading cause of heart failure. Here we report thattranscription factor GATA-4 is a survival factor for differentiated,postnatalcardiomyocytesandanupstreamactivatoroftheantiapo-ptotic gene Bcl-X . An early event in the cardiotoxic effect of the
antitumor drug doxorubicin is GATA-4 depletion, which in turncauses cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Mouse heterozygotes for a nullGata4 allele have enhanced susceptibility to doxorubicin cardio-
toxicity. Genetic or pharmacologic enhancement of GATA-4 pre-vents cardiomyocyte apoptosis and drug-induced cardiotoxicity.The results indicate that GATA-4 is an antiapoptotic factor requiredfor the adaptive stress response of the adult heart. Modulation ofsurvival /H20862apoptosis genes by tissue-speciﬁc transcription factors
may be a general paradigm that can be exploited effectively forcell-speciﬁc regulation of apoptosis in disease states.

Over the past years, a great deal has been learned about the
mechanisms of cardiomyocyte differentiation, heart devel-
opment, and pathologic myocyte growth (1). Much less isunderstood with respect to the regulation of myocyte survival.Unlike other organs, the heart has a limited regenerative po-tential, and myocyte loss is a determining factor of cardiacdysfunction (CD), the leading cause of mortality in industrializedcountries. It is now well established that myocyte death occurslargely through apoptosis (2–4). However, and despite theobvious relevance to human disease, the mechanisms that reg-ulate apoptosis of differentiated cardiomyocytes remain poorlyunderstood.
Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an evolutionarily
conserved mechanism, allowing the removal of damaged orunwanted cells from the organisms through activation of a set ofproteases known as caspases (5). Caspase activation can betriggered either by engagement of cell surface ‘‘death receptors’’(6) or by cellular stress (7, 8). The Bcl-2 family of proteins arekey regulators of the stress-induced apoptotic pathway (9), andalterations in the ratio of pro- /H20862antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family mem-
bers affect myocyte survival and have been observed in a varietyof experimental and clinical settings (10, 11). These changesoften occur at transcriptional levels, yet little is known regardingtranscriptional regulation and upstream activators of the Bcl-2
gene family.
Myocyte apoptosis can be induced by numerous stimuli in-
cluding ischemia, proinflammatory cytokines, and antitumortreatments (10). In fact, cardiac toxicity caused by myocyteapoptosis is a major complication of several chemotherapeuticregimens, especially those involving anthracyclines, which areamong the most effective and widely used antitumor agents (12,13). Several lines of evidence suggest that the progressiveanthracycline-induced cardiomyopathies result from an initialsubtle effect on the myocyte-differentiation program that altersmyocyte survival and, ultimately, the adaptive response of theheart. Genes with expression that is inhibited by anthracyclinesinclude sarcomeric genes, genes encoding energy-producing
enzymes, and transcription factors (14–17).
Because identification of the nuclear effectors of anthracy-
clines may provide insight into the regulatory pathways ofmyocyte survival, we set out to characterize the transcriptionalmechanisms underlying anthracycline action in the heart. Theresults reveal that GATA-4, a key regulator of heart develop-ment (18–21), is an essential survival factor for postnatal car-diomyocytes and is depleted rapidly in response to doxorubicin(Dox) treatment. The action of GATA-4 on cell survival involvesdirect regulation of the apoptotic program via transcriptionalactivation of Bcl-X
L. The work suggests that targeting tissue-
specific transcription factors may be an effective approach to
cell-specific regulation of apoptosis.
Methods
Cell Cultures. All procedures with neonatal cardiomyocytes in-
cluding RNA and protein extractions and analysis were asdescribed (19). Dox was used at 300 nM and phenylephrine (Phe)at 100 nM (Sigma). The Bcl-X antibody was purchased fromSanta Cruz Biotechnology.
DNA Vectors. Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) and Rous sarcoma
virus (RSV) reporter plasmids as well as GATA-4 expres-sion vectors and recombinant adenoviruses were describedpreviously (20, 22). The Bcl-X-luc reporter was a kind gift ofHarvey F. Lodish (Massachusetts Institute of Technology,Cambridge) (23).
In Vivo Experiments. Mice (C3H, 60–90 days old, Charles River
Breeding Laboratories) were handled in accordance with insti-tutional guidelines. Experiments were approved by the AnimalEthics Committee of Institut de Recherches Cliniques de Mon-tre´al. The Gata4
/H11001//H11002mice were described in ref. 24. Mice were
treated with 15 mg /H20862kg Dox i.p., saline with or without s.c.
infusion of Phe (1 mg /H20862kg per day), or vehicle (saline containing
0.002% ascorbic acid) by using Alzet microosmotic pump model1002 (Durect Corporation, Cupertino, CA). After the indicatedtime period, the mice were anesthetized with 12–15
/H9262l/H20862g i.p
Avertin (2.5% solution) and killed. Systolic blood pressure wasdetermined by the tail-cuff technique (25). The day beforeechocardiography, the mice were anesthetized (1.5% isoflurane,75 ml /H20862min 100% O
2), and their anterior chests were shaved.
Two-dimensional guided M-mode echocardiography was per-formed under conscious sedation with 15

Results
GATA-4 Is a Survival Factor for Postnatal Cardiomyocytes. ANF is the
major heart secretory product and an essential regulator ofcardiovascular homeostasis (28). ANF transcription is highlyregulated, and molecular dissection of the ANF promoter hascontributed greatly to our present knowledge of cardiac tran-scription and cardiomyocyte differentiation (29).
Transcription of the ANF gene is severely inhibited by Dox
treatment of primary cardiomyocyte cultures (Fig. 1 Aand B).
This effect is elicited rapidly (50% decrease) after onl y3ho f
exposure to Dox (the earliest time examined) and peaks at 12 h.Mutational analysis (Fig. 1 C) revealed that Dox essentially
targets the proximal ANF promoter, and maximal Dox responserequires intact binding sites for the GATA-4 transcription factor;mutation of these sites significantly reduces the response to Dox,whereas mutation of the serum response element (SRE) (30)reduces basal promoter activity but maintains Dox responsive-ness. Mutations or deletions of other cis regulatory elements thatalter basal promoter activity, including AP-1 (31) and the distalSRE (32), had no effect on Dox responsiveness (data not shown).
Together, these findings identified a nuclear pathway for Doxregulation of cardiac transcription and suggested that GATA-4might be a major nuclear target for Dox. This conclusion was
supported further by the finding that GATA-4 but not serumresponse factor binding to the Dox response element wasdecreased dramatically in nuclear extracts prepared from Dox-treated cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1 D). RNA and protein analysis
confirmed that Dox treatment in mice and isolated primarycardiomyocyte cultures causes rapid depletion of GATA-4 (Fig.2). The negative effect of Dox on GATA-4 transcripts wasabrogated by actinomycin D, an inhibitor of RNA polymerase

II-dependent transcription, but not by cycloheximide (Fig. 2 E).
Thus, GATA-4 seems to be an immediate early-response gene to
Dox.
GATA-4, a member of the zinc finger family of GATA
proteins, is a key regulator of the cardiac genetic program(18–20). GATA-4 also is required for the adaptive response of
cardiomyocytes (20, 33, 34). To determine the role of Doxinhibition of GATA-4 on Dox cardiotoxicity, we tested theconsequences of increased GATA-4 activity on Dox effects.First, we used adenovirus-mediated gene transfer to overexpresssense or antisense GATA-4 transcripts in cultured cardiomyo-
cytes. Consistent with our previous results (20), infection ofcardiomyocytes with the antisense vector resulted in /H1102280%
reduction of GATA-4 protein, whereas the sense vector in-creased protein levels by 2- to 3-fold. Overexpression of GATA-4significantly attenuated Dox-induced down-regulation of theANF gene (Fig. 3 A) as well as Dox-induced myocyte apoptosis,
as evidenced by the absence of TUNEL-positive nuclei (Fig. 3 B
and C). In contrast, cells infected with the GATA-4 antisense
vector showed decreased survival in the absence of Dox and anexaggerated response to Dox-induced apoptosis, which wasevidenced by the significant increase of TUNEL-positive cells atearlier time points as well as a 3-fold increase in apoptotic cellsat later time points (Fig. 3 C).
To confirm in vivo the link between GATA-4 depletion and
myocyte apoptosis as well as CD in response to Dox, we analyzedthe cardiac response to a single injection of Dox in miceheterozygous for a null allele of the Gata4 gene and in their
wild-type littermates ( Gata4 null mice are embryonic-lethal and
therefore could not be tested). At baseline, Gata4
/H11001//H11002mice had
similar FS as their wild-type littermates (59% vs. 57.9%).However, although cardiac function was not altered significantlyby Dox treatment in wild-type mice (only one animal showedreduced FS), 75% of Gata4
/H11001//H11002mice showed significantly de-
creased cardiac function, bringing the mean FS of the Gata4/H11001//H11002
mice to 43% vs. 53% in the wild-type group ( P/H110210.05) (Fig. 4).
Given the deteriorating cardiac function of the Gata4/H11001//H11002mice,
the protocol was terminated at this stage, and animals werekilled to determine the rate of myocyte loss in each group.TUNEL assays revealed a 2-fold increase in the percentage ofapoptotic cardiomyocyte nuclei in Gata4
/H11001//H11002mice (0.93 /H110060.12 vs.
0.45/H110060.004; P/H110210.01). Thus, both the in vitro and in vivo data
reveal a critical role for GATA-4 in the survival of terminallydifferentiated cardiomyocytes in response to cardiac stress andsuggest that Dox cardiotoxicity is caused by interference withthis pathway.
GATA-4 Is a Regulator of the Antiapoptotic Gene Bcl-X L.To elucidate
the specific target(s) of GATA-4 in the apoptotic pathway, weused DNA microarrays to analyze changes in gene expression incardiomyocytes in which GATA-4 levels were manipulated.These studies revealed that a 2-fold increase in GATA-4 levels
was associated with up-regulation of Bcl-X
Ltranscripts, a result
that was confirmed further by using real-time quantitative PCR(Fig. 5 A) as well as Western blot analysis (Fig. 5 B). Interestingly,
Dox treatment also was associated with marked down-regulationof the antiapoptotic Bcl-X
Lprotein, and overexpression of
GATA-4 protected against Dox-induced Bcl-X Ldepletion (Fig.
5B). These results suggested that the cardioprotective effect of
GATA-4 may be due in part to direct modulation of the Bcl-X
gene. Two consensus GATA-binding sites are present within the5/H11032region of the Bcl-X gene (Fig. 5 C), upstream of the major
transcription-initiation sites (35). In gel-shift assays, oligonucle-otide probes corresponding to these sites effectively compete forGATA-4 binding (Fig. 5 C Top ) with the proximal GATA site
displaying greater affinity compared with the distal site. More-over, both sites are able to directly bind recombinant or endog-enous GATA-4 present in cardiomyocyte extracts (Fig. 5 C
Middle ), suggesting that Bcl-X may be a direct target for
GATA-4. This interaction was confirmed further in cotransfec-tion assays in which GATA-4 dose-dependently activated aBcl-X-luc reporter (23) up to 6-fold (Fig. 5 D). Moreover, Bcl-X
promoter activity was decreased by 5-fold in cardiomyocytestreated with Dox (Fig. 5 E), showing a direct correlation between
GATA-4 levels and Bcl-X transcription. Together these data
establish GATA-4 as an upstream activator of Bcl-X
L.
Pharmacologic Modulation of GATA-4. The results obtained above
by using genetic modulation of GATA-4 indicated that mainte-nance of GATA-4 activity was crucial for myocyte survival andsuggested that GATA-4 activators may function as cardiopro-tectors. Very few upstream activators of GATA-4 are known,

and most of them, such as bone morphogenetic proteins and
retinoic acid, were characterized during embryonic development(36, 37). Previously, we showed that
/H92511-adrenergic agonists
enhance GATA-4 activity in postnatal cardiomyocytes, in partthrough phosphorylation of its activation domain (20); impor-tantly, GATA-4 was essential for the cytoskeletal response ofcardiomyocytes, arguing that GATA-4 was a downstream targetas well as an effector of
/H92511-agonists in the heart. Interestingly,
/H92511-adrenoreceptor activation has been suggested to play an
important role in cardioprotective mechanisms of ischemicpreconditioning (38). We therefore used the
/H92511-adrenergicagonist Phe to test whether manipulating GATA-4 activity might
attenuate Dox cardiotoxicity and thus to establish the proof ofprinciple that GATA-4 might be an accessible therapeutic target.Phe efficiently protected cardiomyocytes from Dox-inducedapoptosis (Fig. 6 A) and prevented Dox-induced depletion of
GATA-4 and Bcl-X
L(Fig. 6 Band C). The antiapoptotic action
of Phe depended on the presence of GATA-4 (Fig. 6 D).
Next we tested the in vivo benefit of pharmacologic interfer-
ence with GATA-4 depletion. Three groups of mice wereanalyzed: a control group, a group treated with a single dose ofDox, and a group cotreated with Phe and Dox. Low-dose Pheprevented GATA-4 depletion (Fig. 7 A) and cardiomyocyte
apoptosis (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, in animals cotreated with Phe,
myofibril structure appeared more preserved and there was noevidence of myocyte hypertrophy (Fig. 7 C). Echocardiographic
assessment revealed that, although 50% of animals treated withDox developed CD, all animals in the control and Phe-treatedgroups maintained normal cardiac function (Fig. 7 D). Left
ventricular weight and heart rate were not altered by anytreatment. Finally, unlike in the Dox-treated group, all animalsreceiving Phe and Dox were alive by the end of the 2-weekprotocol. We next tested the longer-term benefits of Phe;animals received a single injection of Dox in the presence or notof a 1-week infusion of Phe and monitored for up to 28 days (Fig.7E); this short-term Phe treatment was protective against the
Dox-induced CD that was manifested at later (28 days) timepoints. Together these results reveal that GATA-4 is an imme-diate early target of Dox action and that genetic or pharmaco-logic manipulation of GATA-4 activity can prevent Dox-inducedcardiotoxicity.
Discussion
Previously we showed that depletion of GATA-4 interferes with
in vitro cardiogenesis by down-regulating expression of car-
dioregulators and causing apoptosis of differentiating cardio-blasts, whereas overexpression of GATA-4 up-regulated early

differentiation markers and enhanced cardiogenesis (18). The
data presented extend the role of GATA-4 as a survival factorto terminally differentiated myocytes and reveals that the em-bryonic and postnatal hearts share similar regulators. Interest-ingly, although a 50% reduction in GATA-4 levels did notinterfere with normal embryonic or postnatal mouse develop-ment (24), it did impair the drug-induced stress response, raisingthe possibility that GATA-4 may be an essential component ofthe adaptive response of the adult heart. This would be consis-tent with previous findings that GATA elements are essential tomediate in vivo transcriptional response to pressure or volume
overload (39 –41) as well as our own in vitro findings that
GATA-4 is essential for cytoskeletal reorganization of cardio-myocytes (20).
Dox-induced depletion of GATA-4 may well explain the
maximal cumulative dose tolerance and the latent cardiomyop-athy observed in patients treated with anthracyclines. Support
for this hypothesis comes from the finding that mice with 50%reduction in GATA-4 levels are hyperresponsive to Dox anddisplay greater myocyte loss and CD than wild-type littermates.Moreover, cardiomyocytes with reduced GATA-4 levels areunresponsive to several stimuli (20) and have reduced expressionof several contractile genes and genes encoding hormones,receptors, and ion channels (ref. 19; unpublished data). Thus, adecrease in GATA-4 levels in the heart of patients treated withDox ultimately would impair their ability to respond to workoverload and other stimuli that produce cardiac stress. Restoringor preventing GATA-4 depletion may be an effective approachto cardioprotection.
In this respect, regulation of GATA-4 levels by
/H92511-adrenergic
agonists is noteworthy, because they are in clinical use already(42). The exact mechanism(s) by which
/H92511-adrenergic stimula-
tion counteracts Dox cardiotoxicity is not fully understood yet,but two points are noteworthy. First, although activation of
/H92511-adrenoreceptors can trigger numerous intracellular signaling
cascades, their antiapoptotic effect required GATA-4 and wasabrogated by antisense-mediated GATA-4 down-regulation
(Fig. 6 D). Second, this protective effect was dissociated from the
hypertrophic effect of Phe; in culture, the effect of Phe onGATA-4 and apoptosis was observed after onl y6ho f treatment
in the absence of any biochemical (ANF) or morphologicevidence of myocyte hypertrophy. Finally, in vivo , the low dose
of Phe used did not produce any myocyte hypertrophy orincrease in heart weight (Fig. 7). Still, by preventing depletion ofGATA-4,
/H92511-agonists maintain cardiac gene expression and
myofibril integrity as well as the ability of myocytes to respondto extracellular stimuli and work overload. The use of theseagents in combination therapy with Dox may be beneficial topatients undergoing chemotherapy. Other small molecules thatstabilize or enhance GATA-4 levels may be cardioprotectivealso.
The essential role of GATA-4 as a survival factor may be
explained, at least in part, by its function as an upstream activator
ofBcl-X and hence mitochondrial function and integrity. Recent
work using adenoviral-mediated overexpression of Bcl-X
Lre-
vealed a protective effect against Dox-induced apoptosis andischemic injury (43). The finding that GATA-4 is essential forsurvival of terminally differentiated, growth-arrested myocytesand that it directly regulates transcription of the antiapoptoticgene Bcl-X
Lprovides mechanistic insight for the role of GATA
and other tissue-specific transcription factors in cell survivalindependent of differentiation and proliferation. GATA factorsare DNA-binding proteins that play essential roles in lineagedifferentiation and organogenesis (44, 45). Gene-inactivationstudies have suggested a link between GATA factors and cellsurvival, but it was always associated with differentiation orcell-cycle progression (46 –48). Overexpression of GATA-1 in
differentiating erythroid cells was also shown to up-regulateBcl-2 and Bcl-X
L, although it was again associated with differ-
entiation (49, 50). More recently, Kim et al . (51) showed a

dent of proliferation and /H20862or differentiation was not discussed.
Thus, the data presented in this article show that GATA factorsdirectly regulate the apoptosis program in postnatal, terminallydifferentiated cells by transcriptional activation of Bcl-X . Mod-
ulation of survival /H20862apoptosis genes by tissue-specific transcrip-
tion factors may be a general paradigm that can be exploitedeffectively for cell-specific regulation of apoptosis in disease
states.We are grateful to Drs. Jeffrey Molkentin and Eric Olson for sharing the
Gata4/H11001//H11002mice. We thank Lynda Robitaille, Manon Laprise, Rene ´e
Braun, and Annie Valle ´e for technical help; Lise Laroche for secretarial
