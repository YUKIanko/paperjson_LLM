Abstract
The location, timing and intensity of Nodal signalling are all critical for proper patterning of the vertebrate embryo. Genetic evidence from
mouse and zebrafish indicates that EGF-CFC family members are essential for Nodal ligands to signal. However, the Xenopus EGF-CFC, FRL1,
has been implicated in Wnt signalling and in activation of Erk MAP kinase. Here, we identify two additional Xenopus EGF-CFCs, XCR2 and
XCR3. We have focused on the role of XCR1/FRL1 and XCR3, which are both expressed at gastrula stages when Nodal signalling is active. We
demonstrate spatial and temporal regulation of XCR1 protein expression, whereas XCR3 appears to be expressed ubiquitously. Using gain andloss of function approaches, we show that XCR1 and XCR3 are required for Nodal-related ligands to signal during early Xenopus development.
Moreover, different Nodal-related ligands require different XCRs to signal. When both XCR1 and XCR3 are knocked down, activation of the
Nodal intracellular signal transducer, Smad2, is severely inhibited and neither gastrulation nor mesendoderm formation occurs. Together our
results indicate that the XCRs are important for modulation of the timing and intensity of Nodal signalling in Xenopus embryos.

Introduction
Nodal and closely related ligands are members of the
Transforming Growth Factor- β(TGF- β) superfamily which
play important roles in vertebrate development required for
mesoderm and endoderm specification and patterning, for
promoting gastrulation movements and establishing the left –
right axis ( Hill, 2001; Whitman, 2001 ). Inhibition of Nodal
signalling by targeted disruption in mouse, mutation of the twoNodal-related genes cyclops andsquint in zebrafish or use of
inhibitors such as Lefty or a truncated derivative of Cerberus inXenopus results in defects in the anterior structures, reduced
mesendoderm and defects in the left –right axis ( Whitman,
2001 ). Conversely, ectopic expression of Nodal-related genes in
presumptive ectoderm in Xenopus induces cells to becomemesoderm or endoderm in a dose-dependent fashion ( Schier,
2003 ).
TGF-βligands signal by binding a type II serine/threonine
kinase receptor which then recruits and activates a type Ireceptor. This in turn phosphorylates and activates intracellular
signal transducers, the receptor-regulated Smads ( Shi and
Massagué, 2003 ), which, for the Nodal-related ligands, are
Smad2 and Smad3. These activated Smads form heteromericcomplexes with Smad4, which accumulate in the nucleus and inassociation with specific transcription factors regulate thetranscription of target genes ( Shi and Massagué, 2003 ). In
contrast to the one or three Nodal-related ligands in mammalsand zebrafish, respectively, there are six Nodal-related ligands
(Xnr1-6) in Xenopus and a further three functionally related
ligands: Derrière, Vg-1 and Activin. All but Xnr3 are thought toinduce phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 ( Whitman, 2001 ).
Genetic data from mice and zebrafish indicate that
members of the membrane-bound EGF-CFC family areessential for Nodal signalling ( Schier, 2003 ). This family is
defined by four founding members: mammalian Cripto and

Cryptic ( Ciccodicola et al., 1989; Dono et al., 1993 ), zebrafish
Oep ( Zhang et al., 1998 ) and Xenopus FRL1 (FGF-Related
Ligand) ( Kinoshita et al., 1995 ). They have an N-terminal signal
sequence, a variant Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF)-like motif,a novel cysteine-rich domain called the CFC domain (forCripto-FRL1-Cryptic) and a C-terminal hydrophobic regionbearing a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchor signal(Minchiotti et al., 2000 ). Zebrafish lacking both maternal and
zygotic Oep activity phenocopy the double mutant for squint
andcyclops (Gritsman et al., 1999 ). In mouse, cripto , like nodal ,
is necessary for establishing the anterioposterior axis ( Whitman,
2001 ) and targeted disruption of cryptic results in defects in
left–right asymmetry, a process in which Nodal signalling is
also involved ( Yan et al., 1999 ). Biochemical data indicate that
Cripto physically interacts with Nodal and ALK4 in 293T cells(Yan et al., 2002 ), with Xnr1 and ALK4 in Xenopus embryos
(Harms and Chang, 2003 ) and with Nodal or Xnr1 in the context
of the ALK4/ActRIIB or ALK7/ActRIIB receptor complexes(Cheng et al., 2003; Reissmann et al., 2001; Yeo and Whitman,
2001 ). This has led to a model in which EGF-CFC family
members act as coreceptors required for Nodal to bind thereceptor complexes and thus activate downstream Smads.
In contrast to zebrafish and mouse, there is little evidence that
theXenopus EGF-CFC family member, FRL1, is linked to
Nodal signalling ( Gritsman et al., 1999; Tanegashima et al.,
2004 ). Firstly, it was isolated in a yeast screen as a potential FGF-
receptor ligand ( Kinoshita et al., 1995 ). Recent work has
suggested that FRL1 is involved in neural induction through itsability to inhibit the BMP pathway via the activation of Erk MAPkinase signalling ( Yabe et al., 2003 ). Finally, maternal FRL1 can
interact with Wnt11 to activate the canonical Wnt pathway ( Tao
et al., 2005 ) and when overexpressed, FRL1 can synergise with
Xnr3 ( Yokota et al., 2003 ). Thus, it is thought that FRL1 has a
divergent function to the other EGF-CFC family members.
Here, we identify two additional EGF-CFC family members
that are expressed during early Xenopus development. To reflect
their relationship with other EGF-CFC family members, wepropose to rename FRL1, XCR1, and to name the two newmembers, XCR2 and XCR3 (see also Onuma et al., 2005 ). We
have studied in detail the function of XCR1 and XCR3, whose
mRNAs are expressed ubiquitously both maternally and
zygotically until early neurulation. XCR1 protein expression,in contrast, is temporally and spatially regulated, being primarilyexpressed during gastrula stages in the animal cap and themarginal zone, but not in the vegetal region. Using bothbiochemical and embryological approaches and synergy andloss of function experiments, we demonstrate that XCR1 andXCR3 are essential for Nodal signalling in Xenopus .
Materials and methods
Cloning of Xenopus EGF-CFC family members and other constructs
XCR1 αwas isolated from a stage 10 Xenopus cDNA library in λZAPII by
PCR and cloned into pFTX4K, a derivative of pFTX5 ( Howell and Hill, 1997 ).
The XCR1 αsequence is identical to the published sequence ( Kinoshita et al.,
1995 ) but for one substitution (C184G) (accession number: AJ864897). Full-length XCR1 αwas used as a probe to screen the cDNA library, which resulted in
the isolation of the XCR1 pseudo-allele (XCR1 β, accession number:
AJ864898).
XCR2 (accession number: AJ864899) and XCR3 were both isolated from the
cDNA library by PCR and were cloned into pFTX4K. XCR3 has two splice
forms: XCR3short andXCR3long , which has an insertion of 72 amino acids after
Thr 22 (accession numbers: AJ864900 and AJ864901). The construct UTR-
XCR3short contains 45 nucleotides of 5 ′UTR and the coding sequence of
XCR3short cloned into pFTX4K.
Xnrs 4 ,5and6were subcloned into pFTX4K, and the following constructs
have been described: Xnr1 ,Xnr2 ,mActivin βAandeFGF in pSP64T ( Jones et al.,
1995; Schulte-Merker and Smith, 1995 );Xnr3 andDerrière in pCS2+ ( Smith et
al., 1995; Sun et al., 1999 ).
Embryo manipulations, synthetic mRNA, morpholino injections and in
situ hybridisation
Fertilisation, culture, staging, preparation of synthetic mRNAs for injection
and microinjection of Xenopus embryos were performed as described ( Howell
and Hill, 1997 ). The quantity of synthetic mRNA encoding the Nodal-related
ligands injected at the 1-cell stage was the lowest quantity capable of inducing a
detectable signal on a Western blot using the antiphosphorylated Smad2antibody at stage 8 or 10 (for Derrière). The amounts used were: 125 pg of Xnr1 ,
20 pg of Xnr2 , 1 ng of Xnr3 , 100 pg of Xnr4 ,4 0p go f Xnr5 , 500 pg of Xnr6 ,2 0
pg of Activin βAand 1 ng of Derrière . For XCR1 ,XCR3 andGFP, 250 pg of
synthetic mRNA was injected and for eFGF , 1 ng.
Morpholino oligonucleotides (Gene Tools LLC) designed for XCR1 were:
MO XCR1.1, 5 ′CAAGAAATCTTAAAAACTGCAT3 ′(which targets both
alleles), MO XCR1.2, 5 ′AAACTGCATTGTTTTCTGCAAAGGC3 ′(which
targets XCR1 α)(Yabe et al., 2003 ), and MO XCR1.3, 5 ′ATTTAATGTGTCCT-
CAGCAAAAGCC3 ′(which targets XCR1 β). For the experiments in Fig. 2 ,a
mixture of MO XCR1.1 and MO XCR1.2 was injected; for the experiments in
Fig. 5 , a mixture of MO XCR1.2 and MO XCR1.3 was injected. The latter
combination does not inhibit the translation of the mRNA synthesised frompFTX4K XCR1 α. For XCR3, two morpholinos were designed and injected
together: 5 ′CATGGCACAGTCCTGCTCCAACTAA3 ′and 5 ′CCAGAC-
CATGGCACAGTCCTGCTCC3 ′. The morpholino control was as described
(Howell et al., 2002 ). 40 ng of morpholinos was injected per embryo at the 1-cell
stage.
In situ hybridisation was as described ( Harland, 1991 )w i t hm i n o r
modifications. Antisense probes for Xnot (Gont et al., 1993 ),N-tubulin
(Oschwald et al., 1991 )Xbra ,Mixer andXFKH1 (
Howell et al., 2002 ) were
labelled with digoxigenin-UTP (Roche).
RNase protection assay
Isolation of total RNA from Xenopus embryos, RNase protection assays and
theEF-1αandFGF-R probes were as described ( Howell et al., 1999 ). Other
antisense probes protected nucleotides encoding the following: XCR1 , amino
acids 1 –123; XCR2 , amino acids 1 –106; XCR3 , amino acids 88 –161 of
XCR3short and 160 –251 of XCR3long , resulting in a single protected fragment.
Antibodies, protein extracts and Western blotting
Peptides corresponding to amino acids 63 –79 of XCR1 and 57 –73 of XCR3
were used to generate rabbit antisera against XCR1 and XCR3, respectively.IgGs were precipitated from total sera with caprylic acid and affinity purified.
Other antibodies used were: antiphosphorylated Smad2, antiphosphorylated
Smad1 and anti-Erk (p42/44) (Cell Signalling Technology); antiphosphorylatedErk (clone YT, Sigma); anti-Smad2 and anti-E-cadherin (BD Biosciences) andanti-Smad1 (MADR1, Upstate Technology).
Total cell extracts were prepared by lysing embryos or animal caps in
lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8; 2 mM EDTA pH 8; 1 mM EGTA pH 8; 0.5%NP-40; 25 mM β-glycerophosphate; 100 mM NaF; 20 nM Calyculin A; 100
mM pyrophosphate and proteases inhibitors). For XCR1 and XCR3 blots,
total protein extracts were treated for 1 h at 37°C with PNGase F (New
England Biolabs). The equivalent of one embryo or 10 animal caps was304 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
fractionated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, proteins
were transferred to PDVF membrane (Millipore) and immunoblotted usingstandard techniques. The antiphosphorylated Smad2 signals were quantifiedby gel densitometry using ImageJ and normalised to the total amount of
Smad2. The fold activation corresponds to the ratio with/without XCR1
overexpression for each ligand whereas the repression corresponds to the ratioof phosphorylated Smad2 when XCR expression is impaired/not impaired by
morpholino injection.
Results
Analysis of the temporal expression of XCR1 mRNA and
protein
XCR1 mRNA is expressed maternally and zygotically until
the end of gastrulation (stage 12.5) and then rapidly disappearsat early neurula stages ( Fig. 1 A). The relative expression level
ofXCR1 was determined by normalising to the expression of
theFGF-receptor . The amount of XCR1 mRNA remains
constant until the late blastula stage (stage 9) and then increases2.5-fold at mid-gastrulation. After which, XCR1 mRNA starts to
disappear and is absent by stage 16 ( Fig. 1 A).
XCR1 protein was detected using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody raised against an XCR1 peptide. To aid visualisationof XCR1, the protein extracts were treated or not with PNGase F,
which removes N-linked sugars from glycosylated proteins. The
anti-XCR1 antibody recognised the overexpressed protein ( Fig.
1B, right panel), which migrates at 26/17 kDa before and afterPNGase F treatment, respectively. A similar pattern of bands was
observed in extracts from uninjected embryos, demonstratingthat the antibody recognises the endogenous protein. XCR1protein was detected only at very low levels maternally, itsexpression increased during blastula stages, when levels ofmRNA were constant, and peaked at gastrula stages beforerapidly disappearing at stage 12 ( Fig. 1 B). This pattern of protein
expression differs from that of XCR1 mRNA expression and
indicates that, at blastula stages, expression of XCR1 must be
regulated post-transcriptionally. Because the XCR1 proteinexpression pattern correlates with the temporal pattern of Smad2activation in Xenopus embryo ( Whitman, 2001 ), we investigated
whether it was involved in Nodal signalling.
XCR1 synergises with a subset of Nodal-related ligands in
early Xenopus embryos
InXenopus , there are nine Nodal-related ligands, but when
this study was done, Vg-1 was thought not to be correctlyproessed and active in Xenopus embryos ( Birsoy et al., 2005 )s o
we did not study it further. For the other eight ligands, we injected1-cell embryos with a dose of synthetic mRNA sufficient toinduce only a low level of Smad2 phosphorylation and askedwhether overexpression of XCR1 could potentiate the activity of
the ligands. The embryos were harvested at stage 8 when there is
no phosphorylation of Smad2 by endogenous ligands ( Fig. 2 A,
UI). XCR1 alone did not induce phosphorylation of Smad2.

However, XCR1 potentiated the signalling activity of Xnr1,
Xnr2, Xnr5 and Xnr6, but did not synergise with Xnr3, Xnr4,Activin or Derrière ( Fig. 2 A). Derrière is only active from stage 9
onwards ( Lee et al., 2001 ) but we could not detect any synergybetween Derrière and XCR1 even at later stages (data not
shown). Xnr3 did not induce phosphorylation of Smad2 at anydose, although it was functional as it induced expression ofNCAM in animal caps (data not shown) ( Hansen et al., 1997 ).

Smad2 with the antiphosphorylated Smad2 antibody ( α-PS2). The membrane was stripped and reprobed with the anti-Smad2 antibody ( α-S2) as a loading control. For
Smad2 and P-Smad2, the upper band is full-length Smad2 and the lower one is a spliced variant lacking exon 3 ( Faure et al., 2000 ). Expression of injected XCR1

analysed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with the indicated antibodies (left panel). The histogram shows the quantification of three independent ex periments

antibody ( α-Erk, middle panel) and expression and knockdown of XCR1 were confirmed with the anti-XCR1 antibody (lower panel).306 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
XCR1 is required for signalling by a subset of Nodal-related
ligands in early Xenopus embryos
Having established that XCR1 specifically synergises with a
subset of Nodal-related ligands to activate Smad2, we nextinvestigated the requirement of endogenous XCR1 for signal-ling by Nodal-related ligands. We designed a combination ofmorpholinos which targeted both XCR1 pseudo-alleles. Em-
bryos were injected at the 1-cell stage with synthetic mRNAs
encoding the eight different Nodal-related ligands with eitherthe control morpholino (MO C) or morpholinos against XCR1(MO CR1). At stage 8, animal caps were dissected andcultivated until sibling embryos reached stage 10 and were thenanalysed by Western blotting using the antiphosphorylatedSmad2 antibody ( Fig. 2 B). The efficacy of the morpholinos was
assessed by detecting expression of the endogenous XCR1
protein in embryos injected with MO C or with MO CR1. MO C
did not affect the expression of XCR1, but the injection of MOCR1 severely impaired translation of the endogenous XCR1gene ( Fig. 2 B, lower panel of blots). The knockdown of
endogenous XCR1 by the morpholinos had a significant effecton the ability of Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4, Xnr5 and Xnr6 to activateSmad2. Knockdown of XCR1 had no effect on the signallingactivity of Derrière, Activin or Xnr3 ( Fig. 2 B). Similar results
were obtained when whole embryos at stage 8 were assayed
instead of animal caps (data not shown). This indicates that theeffects are direct.
Both gain and loss of function experiments thus show that
XCR1 is not involved in signalling by Xnr3, Activin andDerrière, but is required for Xnr1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 to be fully active.
Loss or gain of function of XCR1 has no effect on the Erk
signalling pathway
Having demonstrated that XCR1 acts upstream of Smad2,
we investigated its possible involvement in the Erk pathway, asprevious work has implicated XCR1 in this pathway ( Kinoshita
et al., 1995; Yabe et al., 2003; Yokota et al., 2003 ). Extracts
were prepared from embryos at stages 8, 9 and 10 injected withMO CR1, MO C or synthetic RNA encoding XCR1 or a strong
activator of the Erk pathway, eFGF ( LaBonne and Whitman,
1997 ). Activation of the Erk pathway was assessed by Western
blotting with an anti-P-Erk antibody ( Fig. 2 C). Whole embryos
were used, as opposed to explants, in order to avoid woundingeffects known to activate the Erk MAPK pathway ( LaBonne
and Whitman, 1997 ). Overexpression of eFGF potently
activated Erk phosphorylation at all three stages. However,neither overexpressing nor knocking down XCR1 had any
effect on Erk phosphorylation at any of the stages assayed,
suggesting that XCR1 is not involved in Erk signalling.
XCR1 is expressed in the animal cap and the marginal zone,
but not in the vegetal pole of gastrulating embryos
The Smad2 pathway is activated dynamically in a spatially
regulated fashion. Phosphorylated Smad2 first appears in the
marginal zone at stage 8.5. By stage 9.5, it is predominantlypresent in the dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) and in the vegetal
pole (VP), then becomes restricted to the ventral/vegetal side ofthe embryo ( Faure et al., 2000; Whitman, 2001 ).
We investigated whether XCR1 mRNA and protein are
expressed in stage 10 –10.25 embryos where Smad2 activation
is detected. Embryos were dissected into animal caps (AC),marginal zones (MZ), vegetal poles (VP), dorsal and ventralhalves (D and V, respectively), using expression of Sox17 α
(predominantly localised to the vegetal pole) ( Hudson et al.,
1997 ) and Xbra (enriched in the marginal zone) ( Smith et al.,
1991 ) as controls for the dissection. XCR1 mRNA is present
throughout the embryo at this stage and when the levels ofmRNA were quantitated and normalised to EF-1 α, the ratio was
approximately constant ( Fig. 3 A, data not shown). We then
assessed the regional expression of XCR1 by Western blottingprotein extracts from stage 10 –10.25 embryos dissected exactly
as for the RNase protection assay. XCR1 protein is present both
in dorsal and ventral halves at similar levels. It is also present inthe animal cap and the marginal zone, but is not detectable in thevegetal pole ( Fig. 3 B, upper panel). E-cadherin (the loading
control) is detectable in all samples ( Fig. 3 B, lower panel)
demonstrating that membrane proteins have been extracted. Wecompared the expression pattern of XCR1 with the distributionof phosphorylated Smad2 ( Fig. 3 C). Smad2 is expressed
throughout the embryo and is phosphorylated both in the dorsal
and ventral halves and in the marginal zone and strongly in thevegetal pole, but not in the animal cap ( Fig. 3 C).
These data indicate that the pattern of expression of XCR1
protein only partially overlaps with the expression of XCR1
mRNA, suggesting a spatial regulation of XCR1 expression.We have established above that XCR1 is required for signallingby a subset of Nodal ligands. Since Smad2 is strongly activated
in the vegetal region of the embryo in the absence of detectable
levels of XCR1, it is unlikely that XCR1 is responsible for
regulating Nodal signalling there. However, in the marginalzone, expression of XCR1 does correlate with the presence ofphosphorylated Smad2, suggesting a role for XCR1 in Nodalsignalling in this region of the embryo.
Identification of two new EGF-CFC family members
expressed in Xenopus embryos
Since XCR1 can only synergise with a subset of Nodal-
related ligands, and Smad2 is activated in a region of theembryo where XCR1 is not detectable, we looked for otherEGF-CFC family members in Xenopus embryos, and identified
two new family members in EST databases, which we havenamed XCR2 and XCR3 ( Fig. 4 A). We isolated two isoforms of
XCR3 by PCR, XCR3short (XCR3s) and XCR3long (XCR3l),
which differ by an additional 72 amino acids in the N-terminalpart of the protein. The different EGF-CFC family membersshare approximately 30% identity overall, but more than 65%identity in the EGF-like domain and more than 40% in the CFCdomain. They are no more obviously related to Cripto than toCryptic (Fig. S1).
XCR2 mRNA is expressed at an extremely low level
maternally. Zygotic expression of XCR2 starts at stage 12.5 at307 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
the beginning of neurulation, increases until stage 20 and
remains constant thereafter ( Fig. 4 B, upper panel). The pattern
of expression of XCR3 mRNA, in contrast, is similar to that of
XCR1 . Using an RNase protection probe that detects both
XCR3s and XCR3l mRNAs, and normalising to FGF-R
expression, we showed that XCR3 is expressed at a constant
level maternally and zygotically until mid-gastrula (stage 10.5;Fig. 4 B, middle panel) and then is reduced by 80% by stage 14.
The same kinetics were observed using probes specific forXCR3s and XCR3l (data not shown). As for XCR1 ,XCR3
mRNA is present throughout the embryo at stage 10 –10.25
(Fig. S2).
XCR3 is required for signalling by a subset of Nodal-related
ligands in early Xenopus embryos
Since we were primarily interested in the role of EGF-CFC
family members in Nodal signalling during gastrulation, wefocused on XCR3, which is expressed at this stage. We producedan antibody that recognises both XCR3l and XCR3s. XCR3l
migrates at 35/28 kDa and XCR3s at 27/20 kDa before and afterPNGase F treatment, respectively (Fig. S3). Unfortunately, we
were not able to detect endogenous XCR3 in total Xenopus
embryo extracts, possibly because the antibody is not sensitiveenough or because endogenous XCR3 is present only at low
levels. However, we designed morpholinos that could specifi-
cally prevent the translation of a synthetic mRNA containing the5′UTR and the coding sequence of XCR3s (Fig. S3).
We investigated the role of XCR3 in Nodal signalling,
performing both synergy and knockdown experiments as wehad done for XCR1. We were unable to demonstrate synergybetween XCR3 and any of the eight Nodal-related ligands (datanot shown), possibly because there is already sufficient XCR3
in the embryo for the ligands to signal efficiently. However, we
could demonstrate a requirement for XCR3 for signalling by asubset of Nodal-related ligands in knockdown experiments.Knockdown of XCR3 impaired the ability of Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4,Xnr6 and Derrière to activate Smad2, but had no effect on thesignalling activity of Xnr3, Xnr5 and Activin ( Fig. 4 C). The
same results were obtained in extracts from stage 8 embryos,suggesting a direct effect of XCR3 knockdown (data not
shown).
Fig. 3. Spatial expression pattern of XCR1 mRNA and protein. Whole embryos (WE), dorsal halves (D), ventral halves (V), animal caps (AC), marginal zon es (MZ)
and ventral poles (VP) were harvested at stage 10 –10.25 to (A) analyse the expression of XCR1 mRNA and (B) analyse the expression of XCR1 protein. In panel A,
total RNA was purified and XCR1 expression was assayed by RNase protection assay. EF-1αwas used as a loading control. In panel B, total protein extracts were
treated ± PNGase F prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE. XCR1 protein was detected using the anti-XCR1 antibody. The two arrows indicate the position of XCR1 p rotein.
E-cadherin was used as a loading control. (C) Total protein extracts not treated with PNGase F as in panel B were analysed for the distribution of activa ted Smad2 by
Western blotting using the antiphosphorylated Smad2 antibody ( α-PS2) and for the distribution of Smad2 using the anti-Smad2 antibody ( α-S2).308 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
XCR1 and XCR3 are therefore required for signalling by a
partially overlapping subset of ligands. Xnr5 signalling
specifically requires XCR1 and signalling by Derrière specif-
ically requires XCR3. Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4 and Xnr6 require bothXCR1 and XCR3 to signal efficiently.
XCR1 and XCR3 are necessary for full activation of the Smad2
pathway
To assess the role of XCR1 and XCR3 on signalling by
endogenous Nodal-related ligands, embryos were injected at the1-cell stage with morpholinos against XCR1 (CR1), morpho-
linos against XCR3 (CR3), a combination of morpholinos
against both XCRs (CR1 + CR3) or the morpholino control
(MO C). At stage 9, depletion of XCR1 or XCR3 individuallyhad no effect, but knockdown of both had a small, butreproducible effect on the phosphorylation of Smad2 ( Fig. 5 A,
upper panel). At stage 10, knockdown of XCR3 had a smalleffect on Smad2 phosphorylation compared to embryos injectedwith MO C and impairing expression of both XCR1 and XCR3had a strong effect on the activation of the Smad2 pathway. At

activate Smad2 to almost the same extent as embryos injected
with MO CR1 + CR3 ( Fig. 5 A, upper panel), suggesting that by
stage 10.5 most of the endogenous ligands are XCR3-dependentrather than XCR1-dependent.
We also investigated whether XCR1 and/or XCR3 are
involved in the Smad1 or the Erk pathways ( Fig. 5 A). Injection
of morpholinos against XCR1 and XCR3, individually ortogether, had no effect on the activation of the Smad1 or the Erk
pathways, indicating that these EGF-CFC family members are
specific for the Smad2 pathway in Xenopus embryos. The
effects of the morpholinos are specific as coinjection ofsynthetic mRNAs encoding XCR1 and XCR3 which areresistant to the morpholinos rescued the loss of phosphorylatedSmad2 ( Fig. 5 B).
XCR3 is necessary for Smad2 activation in the vegetal region
We next investigated the contribution of XCR1 and XCR3
to Nodal signalling in different regions of the embryo, inparticular assessing whether XCR3 is active in the vegetalregion. Embryos were injected as indicated in Fig. 5 A
together with a synthetic mRNA encoding GFP and weselected only the GFP-posi tive embryos. At stage 10,
knockdown of XCR1 or XCR3 individually or together had
a strong effect on the activation of Smad2 in the marginal
zone, which could be rescued by the expression of XCR1 andXCR3 ( Fig. 5 C, left panel). In the vegetal pole, knockdown
of XCR1 had no effect on Smad2 phosphorylation asexpected, but the injection of MO CR3 substantiallydecreased Smad2 phosphorylation, showing that XCR3protein is present and necessary for Nodal signalling in thevegetal pole. This effect was specific as it could be rescued
by expression of XCR1 and XCR3 ( Fig. 5 C, right panel).
Interestingly, either XCR1 or XCR3 can rescue the loss ofSmad2 phosphorylation in the vegetal pole, suggesting thatXCR1-dependent ligand(s) is/are functional in this region, butbecause XCR1 is not normally expressed there, they mightnot be fully active ( Fig. 5 D).
Thus, both XCR1 and XCR3 are involved in endogenous
Nodal signalling in gastrulating embryos. XCR1 activity is
restricted to the marginal zone, but XCR3 is active both in the
marginal zone and the vegetal pole.
Downregulation of XCR1 and/or XCR3 expression impairs
Xenopus development
Having established the role of XCR1 and XCR3 in the
activation of the Nodal/Smad2 pathway during gastrulation, we
then analysed the phenotype of XCR1 and/or XCR3 morphants
(Fig. 6 ).Table 1 summarises three independent experiments.
Depletion of XCR1 alone does not inhibit the formation of
the blastopore lip, although it delays its formation. XCR3morphants in contrast have a much stronger phenotype. Theblastopore lip failed to form in 32% of the embryos. In 45% ofthe XCR3 morphants, the formation of the lip was severelydelayed, misplaced and did not close. Embryos depleted of
both XCR1 and XCR3 exhibited an even stronger phenotypeand 78% of them had no blastopore lip and did not gastrulate.
These results suggest that XCR1 does play a role duringgastrulation but its function is partially redundant with that ofXCR3 at this stage. These effects are specific, as the MO C-injected embryos develop as the uninjected embryos. More-over, the phenotype of the XCR1 + XCR3 morphants can berescued by the expression of XCR1 and XCR3 in 85% of the
embryos ( n= 62, Fig. 6 B).
As most of the XCR3 and XCR1 + XCR3 morphants do not
gastrulate and subsequently die ( Fig. 6 C), we only studied the
phenotype of XCR1 morphants at later stages. At neurulastages, embryos depleted for XCR1 lacked almost all theanterior neural structures and failed to close their neural tube(Fig. 6 D, upper panels). This phenotype is also evident at the
tailbud stage when XCR1 morphants have reduced anterior
structures (most noticeably the eye) and reduced neural crestTable 1

derivatives. These embryos were overall shorter compared to
controls ( Fig. 6 D, lower panels).
Because XCR1 and XCR3 morphants have gastrulation
defects, we investigated the expression patterns of mesendo-dermal markers by whole-mount in situ hybridisation ( Fig. 6 E).
At mid-gastrula stages, the expression of dorsal mesendodermalmarkers such as XFKH1 ,Xnot,Xbra andMixer was reduced in
both XCR1 and XCR3 morphants and totally absent in the
double morphants. The ability of Xnr1 to induce mesendodermal
markers in animal caps was also impaired by knocking down theexpression of XCR1 and XCR3 (Fig. S4). At later stages,embryos deficient in XCR1 exhibited a strong neuronal defect,and we found that they showed a downregulation of the neuralmarker N-tubulin (Fig. 6 F, upper panels) but not of the posterior
mesodermal marker, Xnot (Fig. 6 F, lower panels). In contrast, the
few XCR3 morphants surviving to neurula stages showed a
reduced expression of Xnot, but not of N-tubulin (Fig. S5).
Altogether, these results show that XCR3 is required for the
specification of the mesendoderm at gastrula stages, but doesnot seem to play a role in the neural specification. In contrast,XCR1 is not essential for the gastrulation to occur, possiblybecause of redundancy with XCR3, but plays an important rolein the formation of anterior and neural tissues.
Discussion
The EGF-CFC family in Xenopus embryos
Here, we show that at least three EGF-CFC family members
are expressed during early Xenopus development, which are well
conserved in the EGF-like and CFC domains. XCR1 is cleavedboth at the N- and C-termini (our unpublished data) suggesting
that it is GPI-linked and expressed at the cell surface as has been
reported for hCripto ( Minchiotti et al., 2000 ). In addition, the
change in mobility after PNGase F treatment of endogenousXCR1, as well as all XCRs when overexpressed, demonstratesthat these proteins are N-glycosylated in Xenopus embryos.
Human Cripto has also been shown to be O-fucosylated on Thr
88 and this is essential for its activity ( Schiffer et al., 2001 ). The
fucosylation site is conserved in all three XCRs, but we do not
know yet whether Xenopus EGF-CFCs are fucosylated.
XCR1 mRNA is expressed ubiquitously throughout the
embryo up until stage 14. However, using an antibody whichrecognises the endogenous protein, we show that XCR1 is onlyvery weakly expressed maternally. Its expression increasesduring blastula stages, at a time when mRNA levels areconstant, to peak at stage 11. XCR1 protein then disappearsrapidly and is not detectable after stage 12. Thus, the protein
levels are temporally regulated independently of the mRNA
levels. Furthermore, the protein is present only in the animal capand the marginal zone of stage 10 embryos and is absent fromthe vegetal pole, whereas the mRNA is ubiquitously expressed.Several possible mechanisms could explain these results. Thestability of the protein could be regulated temporally andspatially. We cannot completely rule this out, but believe it isunlikely because upon synthetic mRNA injection, XCR1 is
expressed as early as stage 4, indicating that the protein isprobably stable at these early stages (our unpublished data).
Another possibility that is currently under investigation, is thatXCR1 mRNA is subject to translational control. Indeed, in
Xenopus , polyadenylation of some mRNAs has been shown to
be regulated during development ( Simon and Richter, 1994 ). It
is possible that expression of XCR3 is also regulated spatiallyand temporally, but we have been unable to address this as wecould not detect endogenous XCR3 with our antibody.
EGF-CFC family members act as coreceptors for Nodal in
Xenopus embryos
Here, we demonstrate that Nodal-related ligands in Xenopus
embryos require members of the EGF-CFC family to signal. Byperforming both gain and loss of function experiments, we haveshown that the requirement of the different Xenopus Nodal-
related ligands for EGF-CFCs is not identical. Xnr5 signalling is
dependent only on XCR1, Derrière signalling requires onlyXCR3 and maximal signalling by Xnr1, 2, 4 and 6 requires bothXCR1 and XCR3 ( Fig. 7 A). Xnr3 does not activate Smad2
under any condition tested. We also found that Activin signalsindependently of XCRs, which is consistent with previouspublished observations in zebrafish ( Gritsman et al., 1999 ).
Knockdown of both XCR1 and XCR3 strongly reduces the
activation of Smad2 by endogenous ligands at late blastula and
early gastrula stages, but does not affect the Smad1 or ErkMAPK pathways. This strongly suggests that EGF-CFCs arespecific for the Smad2 pathway during Xenopus gastrulation.
We have investigated the phenotypic consequences of theknockdown of XCR1 and XCR3 during development. Atgastrulation stages, XCR1 morphants are delayed but doeventually gastrulate and exhibit defects at neurula stages in
the neural tube and anterior structures, consistent with a
previous study ( Yabe et al., 2003
). XCR3 morphants have a
much stronger phenotype at gastrula stages with more than 60%of the embryos failing to develop further. Importantly, thedouble knockdown gives an even more severe phenotype thanknocking down either XCR1 or XCR3 individually, with 94%of the embryos either dying before stage 14 or exhibiting severegastrulation defects ( Fig. 6 ;Table 1 ). The phenotype of the
XCR1 + XCR3 morphant embryos is consistent with the
phenotype of VegT-depleted embryos, which do not expressXnr1, 2, 4 or Derrière ( Kofron et al., 1999 ) or embryos injected
with Cer-S, a well-characterised Xnr inhibitor ( Agius et al.,
2000 ). The fact that the XCR1 + XCR3 morphant embryos have
a stronger gastrulation phenotype than the XCR3-depletedembryos indicates that XCR1 also has a role in gastrulation,which is masked by the presence of the ubiquitously expressed
XCR3. The presence of XCR3 might explain why this
gastrulation role for XCR1 was not previously detected ( Yabe
et al., 2003 ). XCR1, in contrast, cannot compensate effectively
for loss of XCR3, probably because it is absent from the vegetalpole, where Nodal signalling is high.
It should be noted that knockdown of XCR1 and XCR3 does
not completely abolish Smad2 phosphorylation, which could bedue to incomplete knockdown of these proteins. Indeed, the
effect of morpholinos against XCR1 and/or XCR3 is much313 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
clearer when GFP is coinjected and only GFP-positive embryos
are analysed (compare Figs. 5 A and C). Alternatively, it could be
due to the presence of yet unknown EGF-CFC members or thepresence of endogenous Activin, which has been recently shownto be expressed during early Xenopus development ( Piepenburg
et al., 2004 ) and whose activity is EGF-CFC-independent.
It was previously suggested that XCR1 synergises with Xnr3
in an animal cap elongation assay, and that this requiressignalling through the FGF receptor ( Yokota et al., 2003 ), and it
was also reported that XCR1 induces neural genes through the
inhibition of the BMP pathway via activation of the MAPKpathway ( Kinoshita et al., 1995; Yabe et al., 2003 ). Although we
also observe neural defects in the XCR1 morphants, we wereunable to demonstrate any role for XCRs in the Erk MAPKpathway or the BMP pathway, as measured by Smad1 activation,suggesting that the neural phenotype may arise indirectly as aresult of a defect in the specification of the organiser in these
embryos. Nevertheless, our experiments cannot completely ruleout an involvement of the XCRs in other signalling pathways.
Maternal XCR1 (FRL1) has also been proposed to be involved
in the specification of the dorso-ventral axis through itsinteraction with Wnt11 ( Tao et al., 2005 ). We have not addressed
the role of maternal XCR1, but have focused on the function ofthe zygotically expressed protein.
In summary, our data clearly demonstrate that Xenopus EGF-
CFCs are necessary for the different Nodal family members toactivate their downstream signalling pathways. Furthermore,
we show that XCR1 and XCR3 have different specificities for
the different Nodal-related ligands ( Fig. 7 A).
Why are multiple EGF-CFCs expressed at the gastrula stage of
Xenopus embryos?
We have shown that two EGF-CFCs are expressed during the
gastrula stages of Xenopus embryogenesis which have different
specificities for the Nodal-related ligands. Their pattern of

requires XCR1; Derrière requires XCR3. Xnr1, Xnr2, Xnr4 and Xnr6 require both XCR1 or XCR3 to signal efficiently. (B) EGF-CFC expression patterns in t he
embryo will dictate patterns of Nodal signalling. The vegetal pole is shown in green, the marginal zone in pink and the animal cap in blue. For details, s ee Discussion.314 K. Dorey, C.S. Hill / Developmental Biology 292 (2006) 303 –316
expression is not identical. XCR1 protein is only expressed in
the animal cap and marginal zone, whereas our morpholino datasuggest that XCR3 protein is expressed throughout the embryo,since knocking it down in animal caps, marginal zones orvegetal poles has a marked effect on either endogenous orexogenous Nodal signalling. Several non-mutually exclusivepossibilities can be envisaged to explain why at least two EGF-CFCs are expressed during gastrulation.
The EGF-CFCs could be required for the different Nodal-
related ligands to signal through different receptor complexes.Little is known about which specific receptor complexes thedifferent Xnrs bind to, although there is some indication thatALK7 is required for Xnr1 activity, but not for the activity ofXnr2. However, these Xnrs have the same requirement for EGF-CFCs as they require both XCR1 and 3 for activity, which wouldsuggest that, at least for the type I receptors, there is no
specificity for a particular EGF-CFC. Alternatively, different
EGF-CFCs could confer different signalling properties on theXnrs. We could not find a good correlation, however, betweenthe ability of a specific ligand to activate a given gene and itsdependency on a particular EGF-CFC to signal.
Perhaps the most likely reason for the existence of multiple
EGF-CFCs during gastrulation is to modify the spatial andtemporal activity of Nodal-related ligands ( Fig. 7 B). Although
we know little about where each Nodal-related protein is
expressed, the broad boundaries of expression can be inferredfrom their mRNA expression patterns. In situ hybridisationindicates that Xnr5 and6are the first to be expressed in the
presumptive endoderm from stage 8+ ( Takahashi et al., 2000 ).
Xnr1 and2are expressed somewhat later and accumulate in the
dorsal marginal zone by stage 10 and Xnr4 expression is
restricted to the deep cells of the organiser at this stage ( Jones et
al., 1995; Joseph and Melton, 1997 ).Derrière is initially
expressed throughout the presumptive mesendoderm and is thenrestricted to posterior mesendoderm ( Sun et al., 1999 ). Derrière
activity requires XCR3, which appears to be ubiquitouslyexpressed. Thus, Derrière is probably active wherever it isexpressed. Xnr5, however, which requires XCR1, will only beactive in regions where its expression overlaps with that ofXCR1. The dependency of Xnr1, 2, 4 and 6 on both XCR1 and
XCR3 for their full activity will limit the maximal activity of
these ligands to regions of the embryo where both XCRs and theligands are expressed. These ideas will be more systematicallytested in the future when it is possible to determine exactly wherethe different ligands are expressed.
In summary, we show here that at least two EFC-CFC family
members are expressed during gastrulation in Xenopus
embryos. Our data indicate that the different Nodal-related
ligands require different EGF-CFC family members to signal in
gastrulating embryos. We propose that this is important for theregulation and modulation of signalling by Nodal-relatedligands during gastrulation.
