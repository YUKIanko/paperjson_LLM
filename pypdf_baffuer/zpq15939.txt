Changes in transcription factor levels and activities dictate devel-
opmental fate. Such a change might affect the full ensemble oftarget genes for a factor or only uniquely sensitive targets. Weinvestigated the relationship among activity of the hematopoietictranscription factor GATA-1, chromatin occupancy, and target genesensitivity. Graded activation of GATA-1 in GATA-1-null cells re-vealed high-, intermediate-, and low-sensitivity targets. GATA-1activity requirements for occupancy and transcription often corre-lated. A GATA-1 amino-terminal deletion mutant severely dereg-ulated the low-sensitivity gene Tac-2 . Thus, cells expressing
different levels of a cell type-speciﬁc activator can have qualita-tively distinct target gene expression patterns, and factor muta-tions preferentially deregulate low-sensitivity genes. Unlike othertarget genes, GATA-1-mediated Tac-2 regulation was bimodal,
with activation followed by repression, and the coregulator Friendof GATA-1 (FOG-1) selectively mediated repression. A GATA-1mutant defective in FOG-1 binding occupied a Tac-2 regulatory
region at levels higher than wild-type GATA-1, whereas FOG-1facilitated chromatin occupancy at a distinct target site. Theseresults indicate that FOG-1 is a determinant of GATA factor tar-get gene sensitivity by either facilitating or opposing chromatinoccupancy.

Changes in transcription factor levels and activities underlie the
regulation of key processes such as cell differentiation, prolif-
eration, and survival. Transcription factors often occupy variants oftheir cognate cis elements at target genes, and such variants canhave distinct binding affinities in vitro . Thus, changes in transcrip-
tion factor activities might result in differential occupancy of targetgenes commensurate with in vitro binding affinities. However,
affinities measured with oligonucleotides might not correlate withchromatin occupancy, and rules governing chromatin occupancyare poorly understood. Considerable progress has been made indefining chromatin target sites for GATA transcription factorfamily members.
GATA-1 and GATA-2 have distinct and shared roles to regulate
hematopoiesis (1). GATA-2 promotes the proliferation and sur-vival of multipotent precursors (2, 3), whereas GATA-1 regulateserythroid, megakaryocyte, and eosinophil differentiation (4–7).GATA factors engage DNA and coregulators via a dual zinc fingerdomain (8), and other regions modulate activity (9, 10). GATA-1increases histone acetylation, dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine4 (11–13), and RNA polymerase II recruitment (14) and induceshigher-order chromatin changes (15).
GATA-1 and GATA-2 preferentially bind (A /H20862T)GATA(A /H20862G)
in vitro (16, 17) but also recognize GATC (16, 18). GATA motifs
are abundant in DNA and reside at most erythroid-specific genes(8, 19). GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupy a small subset of theconserved GATA motifs at the
/H9252-globin locus with qualitatively
similar patterns (13, 14). Sites can differ in apparent affinities, as
/H9252major promoter occupancy requires a greater activity /H20862level of an
estrogen receptor (ER) ligand binding domain fusion to GATA-1(ER-GATA-1) vs. the locus control region (13). At the Gata2 and
/H9251-globin loci, GATA-1 and GATA-2 have common and unique
target sites. GATA-2 occupies sites 3.9, 2.8, and 1.8 kb upstream ofthe active Gata2 1S promoter (20, 21). GATA-1-induced Gata2
repression involves ‘‘GATA switches’’ in which GATA-1 replacesGATA-2 at /H110023.9- and /H110022.8-kb regions. GATA-1-mediated loss
of GATA-2 occupancy at the /H110021.8-kb site occurs without high-level
GATA-1 occupancy. At the
/H9251-globin locus, GATA-2 occupies
DNaseI hypersensitive site-12 (HS-12) and HS-26, whereasGATA-1 occupies these and additional regions later in develop-ment (22).
GATA factor chromatin occupancy is likely to be regulated by
GATA motif features, chromatin, neighboring cis elements, andGATA factor concentration (23, 24). GATA-1 DNA bindingactivity is 10-fold greater in primitive vs. definitive chicken ery-throid cells (25), although the consequence of this differencevis-a`-vis chromatin occupancy is unknown. In the GATA-1-null
mouse embryonic stem cell-derived erythroid cell line G1E, ER-GATA-1 preferentially occupies sites at the
/H9252-globin locus in which
high-level histone acetylation and chromatin accessibility are pre-established (13). GATA-1 binds the acetyltransferases CBP /H20862p300
(26) and induces histone acetylation (11, 12), but whether CBP /H20862
p300 enhance GATA-1 occupancy is unknown. The GATA-1 andGATA-2 coregulator Friend of GATA-1 (FOG-1), which mediatesactivation and repression (27), facilitates GATA-1 occupancy (28,29) and GATA switches (28). FOG-1 represses GATA-1 targetgenes via the NuRD corepressor complex (30). GATA-1 binds Sp1
and EKLF transcription factors (31, 32), and their DNA bindingsites can coreside with GATA motifs, but it is unclear whether thesefactors regulate GATA-1 occupancy.
How GATA-1 concentration relates to chromatin occupancy and
gene expression is of considerable interest. The absence (33) orsevere depletion (34) of GATA-1 in mice is embryonic-lethalbecause of defective primitive erythropoiesis, and a 5-fold reductionin GATA-1 delays erythropoiesis (35). Mutations that reduceGATA-1 activity uncouple survival, proliferation, and differentia-tion functions of GATA-1. As little as 5% GATA-1 expressionprotects cells from apoptosis and induces leukemogenesis (36). Inhumans with Down syndrome, expression of a ‘‘short’’ GATA-1(GATA-1s) lacking amino-terminal sequences is linked to a tran-sient myeloproliferative disorder and acute megakaryoblastic leu-kemia (37–39).

deregulates genes that promote proliferation, which are normally
repressed by GATA-1 (39, 40).
The findings described above highlight the importance of under-
standing the relationship between GATA factor levels, chromatinoccupancy, and target gene regulation. Herein, we segregateGATA-1 target genes based on differential sensitivities to GATA-1levels and provide evidence that various factor levels /H20862activities
establish qualitatively distinct expression profiles. Furthermore,analysis of the low-sensitivity GATA-1 target gene Tac-2 revealed
mechanistic insights into GATA-1 and FOG-1 function.
Results and Discussion
Differential Sensitivities of GATA-1 Target Genes. Conditional acti-
vation of ER-GATA-1 stably expressed in GATA-1-null G1E cells(G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells) induces differentiation, recapitulating anormal window of erythropoiesis (41). Treating G1E-ER-GATA-1cells with increasing concentrations of
/H9252-estradiol or tamoxifen
yields graded ER-GATA-1 occupancy at chromatin sites (13, 21).ER-GATA-1 activation involves both increased ER-GATA-1 levels(Fig. 6, which is published as supporting information on the PNAS
web site) and increased activity. Using this approach, we testedwhether GATA-1 target genes respond similarly or distinctly tochanges in the GATA-1 level /H20862activity. G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of
/H9252-estradiol for 16 h, and
GATA-1 target gene expression was quantitated (Fig. 1 A). A low
ER-GATA-1 level /H20862activity repressed Gata2 ,Nab2 , and Lyl1 and
activated /H9251-globin ,/H9252major ,Slc4a1 ,Fog1,Abcb10 ,Ebp4.9 , and Ahsp.
A moderate level /H20862activity activated Gtlf3b ,Ptdss2 ,Cldn13 ,Alas2 ,
andCsF2r /H92522and repressed c-Myb andRgs18 . A high level /H20862activity
activated Tac-2 . These results demonstrating differential sensitivi-
ties of GATA-1 target genes (Fig. 1 B) were not predictable based
on the kinetics of GATA-1 target gene expression upon maximalER-GATA-1 activation, because Gata2 repression and
/H9252major
activation are early and late events, respectively (42).
A fundamental determinant of the sensitivity of target loci to a
trans-acting factor is the ease with which the factor accesseschromatin sites. To establish whether differential chromatin accessunderlies the distinct sensitivities, the ER-GATA-1 level /H20862activity
was titrated with 5, 10, or 40 nM
/H9252-estradiol for 16 h, and chromatin
occupancy was measured at sites defined previously (13, 14, 20, 22,28, 43–45). ER-GATA-1 occupied
/H9252-globin HSs1–4 maximally and
the/H9252major promoter nearly maximally in 10 nM /H9252-estradiol-treated
cells (Fig. 2 A)./H9252major expression was also maximal at this con-0255075100% of Maximal Expression

centration (Fig. 1 A). Previously (13) we demonstrated that /H9252major
promoter occupancy requires a greater GATA-1 level /H20862activity than
occupancy at HSs1–4; the 16-h /H9252-estradiol treatment in Fig. 2 was
not optimal for revealing this difference. Consistent with the highER-GATA-1 sensitivity of
/H9251-globin andGata2 ,5n M /H9252-estradiol
induced nearly maximal ER-GATA-1 occupancy at /H9251-globin HS-26
and the Gata2/H110022.8-kb region (Fig. 2 B). Maximal ER-GATA-1
occupancy at the Alas2 intron 8 enhancer required 10 nM /H9252-estra-
diol, and Alas2 activation required moderate ER-GATA-1 activity
(Fig. 1 A). ER-GATA-1 occupancy at Tac-2 intron 7 required a high
ER-GATA-1 level /H20862activity, similar to the /H9252major promoter and
differing from other sites (Fig. 2 B).
Despite having a similar number of A /H20862TGATAA /H20862G,
nGATAA /H20862G, and A /H20862TGATAn motifs, including conserved motifs,
vs. other sites tested (Fig. 2 C),Tac-2 activation requires a consid-
erably higher ER-GATA-1 level /H20862activity than other genes. Tac-2 is
highly induced upon differentiation of human peripheral blooderythroid precursors and is also expressed in mouse Ter119 /H11001bone
marrow erythroid cells (45).
Deletion of the GATA-1 Amino Terminus Severely Deregulates a
Low-Sensitivity Target Gene. GATA-1 amino-terminal sequences
are required for maximal transactivation (9), but the underlyingmechanisms are unknown. Gene expression profiling inmegakaryoblasts from GATA-1s transgenic mice demonstratedthat GATA-1 target genes are differentially deregulated (39, 46).We reasoned that mutations impairing GATA-1 activity preferen-tially affect target genes requiring high GATA-1 activity. To test thisprediction, GATA-1 target gene expression was measured in G1Eclones stably expressing ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) or ER-GATA-1 at
levels differing by /H110212-fold (Fig. 3). ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) activation
with 1
/H9262M/H9252-estradiol for 24 h induced several GATA-1 targets, but
at levels lower than with ER-GATA-1. ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) activated
/H9252major 417-fold, 5-fold lower than with ER-GATA-1. ER-GATA-
1(/H9004N) activated /H9251-globin ,Ahsp, and Alas2/H110214-fold lower than with
ER-GATA-1. ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) repressed Gata2 (20) and c-Kit
(47) 3.5-fold and 2.6-fold lower, respectively, vs. ER-GATA-1.ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) was almost completely defective in activating
Tac-2 .Tac-2 expression increased only in clone 34 (4.6-fold),
whereas activation by ER-GATA-1 averaged 29-fold. The capacityof ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) to partially regulate most GATA-1 target
genes analyzed, yet fail to activate Tac-2 , is consistent with the
greater GATA-1 level /H20862activity requirement for Tac-2 activation.
Because high-level GATA-1( /H90041–83) expression is required to
rescue hematopoiesis in mice with reduced GATA-1 levels (10),low-sensitivity targets might have important functions.
GATA-1 zinc fingers are sufficient for DNA binding with naked
DNA templates (9, 48), but it is unclear whether other GATA-1sequences regulate chromatin occupancy. To determine whetherthe impaired activity of ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) arises from defective
chromatin occupancy, we compared ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) and ER-
GATA-1 chromatin occupancy. ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) and ER-
GATA-1 occupied HS3 and HS4 and the /H110022.8-kb region of Gata2
similarly, demonstrating that ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) fully occupies cer-
tain sites (Fig. 7, which is published as supporting information onthe PNAS web site). ER-GATA-1( /H9004N) occupancy at
/H9251-globin
HS-26, Alas2 intron 8, and Tac-2 intron 7 was /H110152-fold lower,
whereas occupancy at the /H9252major promoter was 4-fold lower vs.
GATA-1. Thus, deletion of the amino terminus variably affectedchromatin occupancy. The /H110152-fold reduction of ER-GATA-1( /H9004N)
occupancy at Tac-2 intron 7 could, in principle, reduce ER-
GATA-1 below a critical threshold required for activation, consid-ering that the absolute level of ER-GATA-1 occupancy at intron 7is lower than at other sites (Fig. 2 AandB). Alternatively, the amino
terminus might enhance Tac-2 activation after DNA binding,
consistent with its transactivation activity (9).Unique Biphasic Tac-2 Expression Pattern. Tac-2 encodes a neuroki-
nin-B (NK-B) precursor protein. Tac-2 is expressed during eryth-
ropoiesis (45), in the placentas of women with preeclampsia (49),and by certain neuronal cells (50). Analysis of ER-GATA-1 occu-pancy at conserved GATA motifs within an /H11015100-kb chromosomal
region containing Tac-2 revealed high-level ER-GATA-1 occu-
pancy at Tac-2 intron 7 (45). To investigate the mechanism under-
lying GATA-1-mediated Tac-2 activation, we tested whether the
kinetics of ER-GATA-1-induced Tac-2 expression resembles that
of other GATA-1 target genes. Tac-2 mRNA increased during the
24-h
/H9252-estradiol treatment (Fig. 4 A), but, in contrast to othermRNA Levels

targets, Tac-2 mRNA declined 11-fold by 40 h. This expression
pattern occurred in two independent G1E-ER-GATA-1 clonallines that varied /H110154-fold in ER-GATA-1 expression (data not
shown).
To test whether biphasic expression results from transcriptional
activation, followed by mRNA destabilization, Tac-2 mRNA sta-
bility was measured after 24 or 40 h of
/H9252-estradiol treatment. Tac-2
mRNA was constant afte r4ho f actinomycin D treatment regard-
less of the duration of /H9252-estradiol treatment (Fig. 4 B). Thus, Tac-2
mRNA is not unstable or destabilized. Because Bcl-xL mRNA,
which increases late in G1E-ER-GATA-1 differentiation (42, 51),had a t
1/2of/H110151 h, the assay discriminates between unstable and
stable mRNAs. Rapid turnover of Tac-2 mRNA therefore does not
explain the reduced mRNA levels, indicating that Tac-2 is tran-
scriptionally repressed.
Because Tac-2 activation requires a high ER-GATA-1 level /H20862
activity and the modestly impaired activity of ER-GATA-1( /H9004N)
catastrophically reduces Tac-2 expression, Tac-2 repression might
result from a small reduction in ER-GATA-1 level /H20862activity late in
differentiation. Western blot analysis after 40 h of /H9252-estradiol
treatment revealed a small decrease in ER-GATA-1, although theER-GATA-1 /H20862tubulin ratio was constant (Fig. 4 C). Under these
conditions, 2- to 3-fold losses in ER-GATA-1 occupancy wereobserved at all chromatin sites tested (Fig. 4 D). Because Tac-2
activation requires the highest GATA-1 level /H20862activity, comparable
decreases in occupancy at all sites might preferentially deregulateTac-2 .
Dual GATA-1-Mediated Activation and Repression of a Target Gene:
Selective FOG-1 Utilization for Repression. FOG-1 facilitates
GATA-1 chromatin occupancy at certain sites, is required forGATA switches (28, 29), and mediates activation and repression.
The GATA-1 amino-terminal zinc finger binds FOG-1 (52, 53), andmutation of V205 within this finger disrupts binding (27, 53).ER-GATA-1(V205) mutants fail to complement GATA-1 loss inGATA-1-null G1E cells and do not regulate most GATA-1 targetgenes (27). GATA-1 increases Eklf(27) and Fog1 (42) transcription
in a FOG-1-independent manner, but GATA-1-null G1E cellsexpress these genes, and GATA-1 only modestly increases theirmRNAs. Thus, although GATA-1 up-regulates Eklf and Fog1,
GATA-1 is dispensable for establishing their active state. Thisfinding contrasts with FOG-1-dependent GATA-1 targets, in whichGATA-1 is often critical for high-level activation or repression.
To determine whether Tac-2 activation is FOG-1-dependent, we
tested whether ER-GATA-1(V205G) can activate Tac-2 (Fig. 5 A).
ER-GATA-1(V205G) activated Tac-2 3- to 4-fold greater than with
ER-GATA-1. Unlike ER-GATA-1, the induction was sustained for40 h (Fig. 5 B). Thus, V205, which is known only to mediate FOG-1
binding, is required for Tac-2 repression but not activation. Fur-
thermore, ER-GATA-1 activated Tac-2 expression 124-fold in
FOG-1-null cells (54) overexpressing ER-GATA-1 (28), whereasAhsp andAlas2 were induced only 2.4- and 15-fold, respectively
(Fig. 5 C). Combined with the V205G mutant data, the results
establish that Tac-2 activation is FOG-1-independent. Tac-2 acti-
vation in G1E and FOG-1-null cells in which differentiation isblocked, the rapid activation kinetics, and GATA-1 occupancy of
the conserved GATA motif-containing intron 7 indicate that Tac-2
is a direct target. Tac-2 is therefore the only FOG-1-independent
GATA-1 target gene reported that critically requires GATA-1 fortranscriptional activity.10100

Because FOG-1 selectively mediated Tac-2 repression, we tested
whether ER-GATA-1 occupancy at Tac-2 intron 7 resulted in
delayed FOG-1 accumulation at this site during the repressionphase. However, FOG-1 occupied intron 7, but not an upstreamevolutionarily conserved region, concomitant with ER-GATA-1occupancy (Fig. 5 D). Similar to ER-GATA-1, FOG-1 occupancy
significantly decreased by 40 h. The FOG-1-associated NuRDcomplex component MTA2 (metastasis-associated protein 2) sim-ilarly occupied intron 7 before repression. Although the NuRDcomplex contains histone deacetylase subunits (30), diacetylatedhistone H3 and multiacetylated H4 at Tac-2 intron 7 and promoter
did not decline upon repression (Fig. 8, which is published assupporting information on the PNAS web site).
Given the FOG-1 requirement for repression, why does maximal
FOG-1 occupancy precede the major decline in Tac-2 mRNA? We
reasoned that either a FOG-1–corepressor complex initiates re-pression and ER-GATA-1-FOG-1 complexes are evicted fromrepressed templates, or FOG-1 actively opposes GATA-1 chroma-tin occupancy (Fig. 5 E). Both models assume that ER-GATA-
1(V205G) defective in FOG-1 binding would occupy Tac-2 intron
7 to a greater extent than ER-GATA-1. ER-GATA-1(V205G)occupancy at intron 7 was /H110153-fold greater than ER-GATA-1 (Fig.
5F), even though ER-GATA-1(V205G) was expressed slightly less
than ER-GATA-1 (data not shown). Almost no ER-GATA-1(V205G) occupancy occurred at the
/H9252major promoter, consistent
with FOG-1 chromatin occupancy facilitator activity (28, 29) (Fig.5F). ER-GATA-1(V205G) and ER-GATA-1 occupied HS3 simi-
larly. Thus, FOG-1 uniquely suppresses GATA-1 chromatin occu-pancy at Tac-2 intron 7.
Mechanistic Insights. Analysis of target gene sensitivity to GATA-1
levels identified a high GATA-1 level /H20862activity requirement for
occupancy and activation of Tac-2 . Unlike other genes studied,
Tac-2 activation is followed by repression. FOG-1 mediates Tac-2
repression but not activation, representing the first example inwhich GATA-1 activates and represses a target gene while selec-tively using FOG-1 for repression.
FOG-1 and MTA2 occupy intron 7 before repression, sug-
gesting that FOG-1–MTA2 repressive activity is initially sup-pressed or insufficient to counter coactivator functions, or thatrepression is a relatively slow process. As ER-GATA-1(V205G)occupies intron 7 and activates Tac-2 greater than ER-GATA-1,
FOG-1 suppresses ER-GATA-1 occupancy at Tac-2 and activa-
tion. Acting like a rheostat, FOG-1 is therefore a key determi-nant of Tac-2 sensitivity to GATA-1 levels. The subsequent
engagement of FOG-1 repressive activity ensures transientactivation. Thus, FOG-1 has context-dependent activity to fa-cilitate GATA-1 chromatin occupancy (28, 29) and to restrict

GENETICS

GATA-1 occupancy. The anti-GATA-1 activity might be related
to FOG-1-mediated repression of erythropoiesis in Xenopus
laevis (55) and blood cell development in Drosophila (56).
The demonstration that GATA-1 target genes are differen-
tially sensitive to the GATA-1 level /H20862activity emphasizes the
importance of defining parameters underlying GATA factorselection of functional target sites in a genome littered withGATA motifs. Target sensitivity involves not only parametersthat determine chromatin occupancy but also those regulatingchromatin-bound factors. It will be particularly instructive toassess the contribution of individual parameters and combina-tions thereof to establishing and regulating target sensitivitiesand the impact of altering these parameters on GATA factor-instigated gene networks.
Methods
Cell Culture. G1E cells expressing ER-GATA-1 constructs were
cultured as described (13).
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR. Total RNA was purified with TRIzol
(GIBCO /H20862BRL, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and cDNA was pre-
pared from 1.5 /H9262g of RNA as described (28). Relative expression
levels were determined by real-time RT-PCR from a standardcurve of serial dilutions of cDNA samples and were normalized toGAPDH expression. Primer sequences are described in Supporting
Materials and Methods .
Quantitative ChIP Assay. ChIP analyses were conducted as described
(57) and as described in Supporting Materials and Methods , which is
published as supporting information on the PNAS web site.
RNA Stability Assay. G1E-ER-GATA-1 cells were pretreated with 1
/H9262M/H9252-estradiol for 24 or 40 h. Cultures were then treated with 10
/H9262g/H20862ml actinomycin D (A1410; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for up to 4 h.
Total RNA was purified and analyzed by real-time RT-PCRanalysis.
Protein Analysis. Total protein was prepared by boiling cells for 5
min in SDS sample buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 6.8 /H20862100 mM DTT /H208622%
SDS /H208620.1% bromophenol blue /H2086210% glycerol) (1 /H11003107cells per
milliliter of buffer). Proteins were analyzed by Western blottingusing ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ). ER-GATA-1fusions were detected with anti-ER antibody AB16.
