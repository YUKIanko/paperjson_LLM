Abstract
Background: GATA factors 4/5/6 have been implicated  in the development of the heart and
endodermal derivatives in vertebrates. Work in ze brafish has indicated that GATA5 is required for
normal development earlier than GATA4/6. However, the GATA5 knockout mouse has no
apparent embryonic phenotype, thereby question ing the importance of the gene for vertebrate
development.
Results: In this study we show that in Xenopus embryos GATA5 is essentia l for early development
of heart and liver precursors. In addition, we have found that in Xenopus embryos GATA4 is
important for development of heart and liver primordi a following their specification, and that in this
role it might interact with GATA6.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that GATA5 acts earl ier than GATA4 to regulate development
of heart and liver precursors, and indicate that one early direct target of GATA5 is homeobox gene
Hex.
Background
GATA4/5/6 Zinc finger-containing transcription factors
are regulators of gene expression in multiple tissues
derived from mesoderm and endoderm in vertebrate
embryos and adults [1-4]. They are expressed in overlap-
ping patterns and share domain structure and most of
their biochemical activities, including DNA binding site
preference, raising a possibility of redundant function in
vivo. Genetic analyses of the roles of GATA4/5/6 genes in
vertebrate development has so far implicated that individ-
ual factors have unique and shared roles. In the mouseGATA4 initially plays an essential role in endodermal
development and indirectly in early heart morphogenesis
[5-7]. Later roles of GATA4 have been revealed by analysis
of a non-null allele that blocks interaction with FOG2
cofactor, by myocardial-specific null mutation, and by
careful analysis of heterozygous null mice [8-10]. A role
for GATA4 in the mouse liver development was recently
examined by tetraploid embryo complementation, and
this work has indicated that GATA4 is required for expan-
sion of liver bud [11]. In zebrafish, knockdown of GATA4
by specific morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) has beenPublished: 28 July 2008

after their specification, in broad agreement with the
results obtained in the mouse model [12].
GATA6 is indispensable for development of exrtraembry-
onic endoderm in the mouse, and also has later roles inthe developing liver and heart, following their specifica-
tion [13]. These findings on the roles of GATA6 in the
mouse are in good agreement with the results from Xeno-
pus and zebrafish models [12,14].
The function of GATA5 has been most extensively studied
in the zebrafish embryo, where faust (GATA5) mutants
were found to display defects in heart and endoderm
development [15,16]. The heart phenotypes of faust
embryos include an almost complete loss of cardiac pro-genitors and morphological defects such as cardia bifida[15]. More recently a role of GATA5 in zebrafish heartmorphogenesis was confirmed by MOs [17]. In contrast,targeting of the GATA5 gene in the mouse was reported to
have no consequences for embryonic development, sug-
gesting that the role of GATA5 in mammals may not beconserved [18].
To improve our understanding of the roles played by
GATA4 and GATA5 in early development of vertebrate
embryos, we have analysed their function in Xenopus
embryos using a gene knockdown approach.
Results
GATA5 is a dosage-sensitive regulator of early heart and 
liver development
To assess the role of GATA5 in Xenopus development we
first used a translation-blocking MO, G5. This MO targetsboth GATA5 pseudoalleles in Xenopus laevis and GATA5
mRNA in diploid Xenopus tropicalis (see Additional File 1).
Doses of 20 ng or greater per X. laevis embryo resulted in
gastrulation defects and lethality by mid-neurula stages.
Therefore, to investigate the role of GATA5 in heart and
liver development doses of 5–10 ng/embryo were used.This dose of G5 MO was shown to specifically and effec-tively block translation of the injected tagged GATA5mRNA (Fig. 1A).
The phenotypes of morphant tadpoles were scored at st.
35–37, when morphogenesis of the beating heart is well
advanced, and is characterised by the expansion of thewalls of looped cardiac tube [19]. At this stage the adja-cent liver primordium is visible as a distinct thickening inthe anterior endoderm. At st. 35–37, the cardiomyocytedifferentiation-specific genes MLC2 and cTnI, and liver-
enriched genes FOR1 and Hex are robustly expressed, and
were used to visualise heart and liver development [20-23].Injection of G5 MO in X. laevis embryos in both blast-
omeres at 2-cell stage or in presumptive anterior blast-
omeres at 4-cell stage caused a severe reduction in the sizeof heart and liver primordia (Fig 1B1-5), whilst posteriortargeting of G5MO (Fig 1B6) or injection of two controlMOs at 50 ng/embryo has no obvious effect (Fig. 1B7-9).G5 MO caused a similar heart phenotype in X. tropicalis
embryos (Fig 1C).
The most frequent phenotype caused by G5MO was an
almost complete loss of cardiac and liver markers (101/146; summarised below). The remaining morphants hada reduction of heart and liver primordia, and only rarely
abnormal morphogenesis of the heart was observed.
Our attempts to rescue GATA5 morphants by injection of
a wide range of GATA5 mRNA amounts proved inconclu-sive (data not shown), most likely because overexpressionof even small amounts of GATA5 mRNA causes a severephenotype [24]; data not shown). It is likely that a suc-
cessful rescue requires the precise regulation of the
amount, place and time of exogenous GATA5 expression.We therefore wished to provide an additional line of evi-dence for the specificity of action of GATA5 MOs bydownregulating GATA5 in a way that would enable assess-ment of the status of endogenous GATA5. To achieve this,
a splice site-blocking MO was used and its action was
monitored by RT-PCR analyses of mRNA. Using genomicsequence available for X. tropicalis , a splice junction block-
ing MO (G5SP) was designed which was predicted tocause in-frame skipping of exon 4. This exon encodes theC-terminal Zn finger (Fig. 2). Injection of G5SP MO
caused an efficient and dose-dependent reduction in the
level of the full-length GATA5 mRNA in X. tropicalis
embryos (Fig. 2A). This MO also caused exon skipping inX. laevis (Fig. 2A, B), indicating conservation of intronic
sequence at the exon/intron and intron/exon boundaries(currently X. laevis GATA5 genomic sequence is not avail-
able to confirm this assumption).
Injection of G5SP MO in both X. laevis and X. tropicalis
resulted in correct in-frame exon 4 skipping, as confirmedby sequencing of PCR products (Fig. 2A). The action ofG5SP MO appeared to be specific for GATA5, sinceGATA4 transcripts were not affected by any of the doses of
this MO analysed (Fig. 2A). Importantly, the phenotype
observed following injection of the low-medium doses(9–18 ng/ X. laevis embryo) was similar to the one pro-
duced by G5 MO, namely, severe heart and liver defects(Fig. 2C). Furthermore, given that 9 ng of G5SP MO elim-inated only approximately half of the full-length GATA5
mRNA (Fig. 2B), these results suggest that in our experi-
ments with translation-blocking MO, only a partial down-regulation of GATA5 was achieved, allowing themorphants to reach tadpole stages. RT-PCR data suggest

(page number not for citation purposes)that doses of G5SP MO above 18 ng (44 and 66 ng) result
in skipping of the exon 4 in all GATA5 transcripts in X. lae-
vis (Fig. 2A, B) and cause severe gastrulation defects and
death (data not shown). In our earlier experiments withhigher doses of the G5 MO (20–50 ng) we observed sim-
ilar phenotypes. Taken together, this data indicate that
higher doses of G5SP and G5 MOs result in complete ornearly complete loss of GATA5 and lethality.
The action of G5SP MO results in the formation of mutant
GATA5 protein with a d
eleted C-terminal Zn finger,
dGATA5 (Fig. 2E). Given that the C-terminus Zn finger is
sufficient for DNA binding of GATA5 [25], we expectedthat the dGATA5 protein would be inactive. This was con-firmed by showing that dGATA5 is unable to activateGATA transcriptional reporter in animal cap explants (Fig.2D). The dGATA5 protein was efficiently expressed in ani-
mal caps, indicating that its lack of transcriptional activity
is likely due to loss of DNA-binding Zn finger, rather thenaltered protein levels (Fig 2E). dGATA5 retains most of thewt coding sequence, including the activation domainsand the N-terminal Zn finger. In order to test if dGATA5retained any activity which enabled it to interact with fac-
tors such as the wild-type GATA5 or GATA4, we modelled
the potential interaction between the wtGATA4/5 anddGATA5 proteins, as it may occur in vivo in G5SP mor-phants where the MO was 50% effective in generating thedGATA5 protein. An equal amount of mRNAs encodingwtGATA4/5 and dGATA5 proteins was co-injected intoembryos together with a GATA transcriptional reporter.
We found that dGATA5 does not substantially alter tran-
scriptional activity of either GATA5 or GATA4 in animalcaps (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the phenotypecaused by the low doses of G5SP MO (9–18 ng) likelyresults from a reduction in the amount of the wt protein.
An additional non-overlapping translation-blocking MO,
G5UTR also caused deficiency in heart and liver tissue(Fig. 3). However, G5UTR MO was less effective (27/69severely affected embryos; Fig. 3B), requiring a 10 timesgreater dose then G5 MO to produce a similar phenotype.
The difference in efficiency between these MOs mightreflect the different location of their target sequencesalong the GATA5 mRNA: the G5 MO target is immediatelydownstream of the START codon, whereas the G5UTR
MO interacts with its target 8 nt upstream (Additional Fig.
1), and its' efficiency might be affected by the 5'UTR sec-ondary structure.
GATA4 is required for hear t and liver development in 
Xenopus  embryos
GATA4 was shown in both zebrafish [12] and mouse
[11,26,27] to be essential for heart and liver developmentfollowing specification, but its role in Xenopus has not
been investigated in detail. To address this question wedesigned a MO targeted against both X. laevis alleles and
X tropicalis GATA4 (Additional File 1). This MO, G4,
causes specific blocking of translation of injected mRNA
(Fig. 4A) and results in heart and liver defects (Fig. 4B andalso Fig. 3). The majority of G4 morphants had heart mor-phogenesis defects but had detectable heart and liver geneexpression (Figs 3, 4). However, in these experiments thestatus of endogenous GATA4 in G4 morphants was
unknown. Therefore, we additionally tested the role of
GATA4 by using a splice-blocking MO, G4SP, which wasdesigned like the G5SP MO to cause in-frame removal ofexon 4 in its target. As shown in Fig. 4D, G4SP MO causeda dose-dependent splicing out of exon 4 in both X. tropi-
calis and X. laevis , resulting in heart and liver defects. G4SP
morphants closely resembled G4 morphants (Fig. 4).
However, the maximum activity of the G4SP MO (~90%
efficiency in inducing splicing) was reached at 80 ng/embryo (Fig. 4D, E), unlike G5SP MO, which was effectivein causing complete splicing above 18 ng/embryo. Furtherincrease in the dose of the G4SP MO to 100 and 120 ng/embryo did not improve the efficiency of splicing (Fig. 4E
and data not shown). This result was observed in both X.
laevis and X. tropicalis (Fig. 4C) and therefore likely repre-
sents inherent property of the G4SP MO, rather then inef-ficient action caused by sequence divergence. G4SP MOInjection of G5 MO, but not of C1 and C2  control MOs, cause severe size reduction or loss of heart and liver in Xenopus embryosFigure 1

logical landmarks, and cement gland (cg) and eyes  (e) have been indicated to add visualisation.

4D).
Importantly, the phenotype caused by the doses of G4SP
MO above 33 ng closely resembled the phenotype of G4
morphants (Fig. 4), suggesting that loss of greater than50% of wt GATA4 leads to heart and liver defects. Theeffect of G4SP MO was dose dependent, with the propor-tion of embryos with cardiac and liver defects increasingfrom 33% at 33 ng/embryo to 95% at 80 ng/embryo (Fig.
3). The GATA4 MOs were far less effective in causing
severe phenotype (severe reduction or loss of heart andliver precursors) than the MOs against GATA5 (summa-rised in Fig. 3). The great majority (80–90%; Fig. 3) ofGATA4 morphants displayed defects in expansion or mor-phogenesis of the heart primordium, including cardia bif-
ida, partial fusion of heart fields and abnormal looping.
These results suggest that GATA4 is required for heartdevelopment after cardiac specification.
GATA5 is required before GATA 4 for development of heart 
and liver precursors
To determine when GATA4 and GATA5 are required for
heart development, we have examined the expression of
Nkx2.5, a marker of heart field in late neurula stages,when it is robustly expressed [28,29]. Another reason forperforming the analysis at st. 22 was that previous fatemapping studies have shown that at st. 22 Nkx2.5-expressing cells contribute to the developing heart [29].
We found that injection of any GATA5 MO, but not
GATA4 or GATA6 MOs [14], cause a substantial reductionin expression of Nkx2.5 (Fig. 5A).The expression of another marker which is expressed in a
subset of cardiac precursors at the same time, Tbx5 [30],was also reduced by GATA5 MO (Additional file 2), pro-viding further evidence that GATA5 is required for specifi-
cation of cardiac precursors. We have additionally tested
the effect of GATA5 MOs on Nkx2.5 expression at st. 14,near its' onset, [28] and just after cardiac specification[31]. Our RT-PCR analyses indicate that GATA5 MOs donot block expression of Nkx2.5 at st. 14 (data not shown).However, as early-expressing Nkx2.5-positive cells have
not been fate mapped, and, more importantly, since there
are no known cardiac-specific markers that uniquely iden-tify cardiac precursors at the time of their specification, theearliest requirement for GATA5 in heart developmentremains unknown at present.
To examine the effect of GATA4 and GATA5 MOs on early
liver precursors, we first established that Hex-expressingcells in the anterior ventral endoderm of st. 22 embryosare fated to become the liver primordium (Additional File3). We next established that injection of G5 MO (Fig. 5B),but not of control MO or GSP4 MO (Fig. 5B, C), leads toan almost complete loss of Hex expression. This result
suggests that GATA5 is required for liver specification.
However, additional specific markers are required toestablish the requirement of early liver precursors forGATA5.
The same dose of G5 MO that causes a reduction of Hex
expression at st. 22 and later cause heart and liver defects
in tadpoles had no effect on Hex expression in gastrulae(data not shown). However, higher doses of G5 and G5SPMOs (that are more effective in downregulation ofG5SP MO creates GATA5 protein lacking the C-termin al Zn finger and causes heart and liver defects Figure 2

at st 11 (Additional file 4). These results indicate that
GATA5 regulates Hex in time- and dose-dependent man-
ner.
We have additionally established that GATA5 is likely to
be a direct regulator of Hex expression, as it is sufficient to
induce Hex mRNA in an immediate-early fashion in gas-
trula-stage animal caps (Fig. 5D). At this stage Hex expres-
sion marks anterior endoderm [23]. Whether Hex is also
an immediate-early target of GATA5 in liver precursors at
st. 22 is not known.
GATA5 is expressed in endoderm during gastrulation and
subsequently during neurula and early tailbud stages in
mesoderm and anterior endoderm [24]. In our experi-ments G5SP MO has been shown to be effective until tad-
pole stages (Additional File 5), having the potential to
affect both early and late phases of GATA5 expression,
which could both be involved in normal development of
heart and liver. Therefore, at present it is not clear when
precisely GATA5 acts in the development of heart and
liver precursors.
Endodermal GATA4 and GATA5 are required for normal 
heart development
GATA4 and GATA5 are expressed in both cardiac meso-
derm and hepatogenic endoderm, and are required for
their normal development. In our experiments we have
downregulated GATA4 and GATA5 in both heart and liver
precursors, and therefore the cell autonomy of their func-
tion was not addressed. To begin to address the specificSummary of effects of GATA4 and GATA5 MOs in Xenopus embryosFigure 3

(page number not for citation purposes)roles of GATA4 and GATA5 in heart and liver precursors
in more detail, we have performed mosaic analysis by tar-geting GATA4 or GATA5 MOs at 32/64 cell-stage to ante-rior-vegetal blastomeres, fated to contribute to anteriorendoderm [32]. MOs were co-injected with rhodamine-dextran, and the fate of injected cells was followed from
tailbud stages. This allowed us to examine heart develop-
ment in real time in embryos with correct (largely anteriorendoderm-specific) targeting. In those embryos heartdevelopment was examined by using cardiac actin GFPreporter transgenic line [33]. As shown in Fig. 6, the pres-ence of both G4SP and G5SP MOs in anterior endoderm
causes abnormal cardiac morphogenesis (defective loop-
ing (Fig. 6C, G) or poor expansion of the ventricle (Fig.6A, E), suggesting that both factors can act in endoderm toaffect the development of neighbouring heart primor-dium. In these experiments we have not observed moresevere phenotypes that have been seen with uniform
injection of the MOs (Figs 1, 2, 3, 4). However, given that
it is difficult to specifically target all anterior endodermalprecursors by injections, and since the efficacy of mosai-cally expressed MOs is unknown, our knowledge of theroles of endodermal GATA4 and GATA5 is still incom-plete.
GATA4 and GATA6 interact in heart and liver development 
in Xenopus  embryos
GATA4/5/6 are expressed in overlapping patterns in heart
and endoderm in vertebrate embryos, and share manybiochemical properties, including the domain structureand DNA binding site preference [1,3,4]. We have
addressed the possibility of redundancy between GATA4
and GATA6, as their knockdowns cause a later and milderheart and liver precursor phenotype than a knockdown ofGATA5 (Fig. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; [14]. Whilst suboptimal doses ofGATA4 and GATA6 (25 and 5 ng, respectively) have no
effect or cause only a mild phenotype, their co-injectioncauses heart and liver defects that resemble the phenotypecaused by 50 ng of the GATA4 MO or 10 ng of the GATA6MO (Fig. 7). These results strongly suggest that GATA4and GATA6 interact during development of heart and
liver.
Discussion
GATA5 is essential for early heart and liver development in 
Xenopus  embryos
In this report we have established that in Xenopus embryos
GATA5 is required for the early development of heart and
liver. Downregulation of GATA5 in both Xenopus laevis
and Xenopus tropicalis using two non-overlapping transla-
tion-blocking MOs and by using a splice-site blocking MOcauses a severe reduction in the number of heart and liverprecursors at the time of or shortly after their specifica-
tion. Our results are in broad agreement with the analysis
of the faust (GATA5) zebrafish mutants, which show
abnormal development of the heart and endodermal tis-sues, including the liver [15,16]. However, the geneticanalyses of GATA5 in zebrafish have been limited by thefact that of two described faust alleles the stronger one
remains uncharacterised at the molecular level, by consid-
erable variability of the phenotype and by a possibility of
maternal contribution [15].
A recent report has examined the roles of GATA4/5/6 in
heart development of Xenopus laevis and zebrafish
embryos [34]. In contrast to our findings, Peterkin et al.
have concluded that in Xenopus embryos GATA5 only
plays a relatively minor role in heart development, afterspecification. This discrepancy likely reflects differentapproaches taken to address the role of GATA5: whilstGATA4 MOs cause defects in heart and liver development Figure 4

to the least effective GATA5 MO (G5UTR) that we have

also documented the efficiency of splice-site blocking MO

that we found that high doses of G5 and G5SP MOs cause

(page number not for citation purposes)reliance of the frog embryo on GATA5 for early develop-
ment, as it is also possible that the apparent difference
reflects maternal contribution to GATA5 function in
zebrafish. Clearly, a direct comparison and more com-
plete answer about the role of GATA5 in Xenopus and
zebrafish will require the generation and characterisation
of embryos without GATA5 activity in both models.
Our results appear to disagree with the reported lack of
embryonic phenotype of the GATA5 gene-targeted mice
[18]. However, it has been suggested that in the mouse the
targeting strategy might not have resulted in a null muta-
tion [35], and it therefore remains to be established
whether GATA5 plays a conserved role in early develop-
ment of mammals.
The findings of our study strongly suggest that GATA5 is
required very early in the development of cardiac and liver
precursors, and are consistent with the reported ability of
GATA5 to induce cardiac and endodermal tissue in Xeno-
pus and zebrafish embryos [15,16,24,36]. Having found
that GATA5 is essential for heart and liver development in
Xenopus embryos, it will now be important to understand
how it acts. Our initial experiments designed to address
the cellular basis of GATA5 action in heart and liver devel-
opment have suggested that GATA5 MOs do not signifi-
cantly alter the pattern of apoptosis or proliferation in
heart and liver precursors at the time when their numbers
are greatly reduced (i.e., st.22; KEH and BVL, unpub-
lished). Whilst it is possible that GATA5 MOs affect cell
proliferation and apoptosis in heart- and liver-forming
area of the embryo at an earlier stage, ultimately better
knowledge of the mechanism of action of GATA5 will
require identification of the target genes that mediate its'Figure 6

In this report we have focused on the role of GATA5 in
heart and liver development, however during the course
of our work we have observed that GATA5 also plays an
essential earlier role, during gastrulation. This early role
was revealed using higher doses of G5SP MO which effi-Interaction between GATA4 and GATA6 in heart and liver developmentFigure 7

severe gastrulation defects and death (data not shown).
However, one limitation of this result is that it remains tobe formally established whether the action of the G5SPMO represents the equivalent of a null mutation, despitethe fact that we found no evidence for activity of themutant dGATA5 protein (Fig 2). A very similar early phe-
notype that likely results from a complete or nearly com-
plete loss of GATA5 activity was obtained by higher dosesof G5 MO (20–40 ng/embryo; Additional file 4 and datanot shown), providing additional evidence that GATA5has an essential role during gastrulation.
The two roles of GATA5 have a differential requirement
for the level of GATA5 protein, with the development ofheart and liver precursors being more sensitive. A part ofour effort to identify targets of GATA5 is currently focusedon isolation of subsets of targets that require different lev-els of GATA5 activity. An interesting precedent for dose-dependent action of GATA factors has recently been estab-
lished for GATA1, which has been shown to directly regu-
late subsets of target genes that differentially respond to itslevels [37].
The role of GATA4 in heart and liver development in 
Xenopus  embryos
Our work shows that in Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropica-
lis GATA4 is required for development of heart and liver
precursors after their specification. This has been estab-lished by using a specific translation-blocking MO and asplice-site blocking MO that operates in a similar mannerto G5SP MO, resulting in the removal of exon 4. However,
unlike G5SP MO, which at doses that cause approximately
50% splicing of its target induces severe heart and liverdefects, the maximal activity of the G4SP MO, 90% ofsplicing of its target, results in a milder phenotype, char-acterised by heart morphogenesis defects. As mentionedabove, one limitation of the results obtained with splice-
blocking GATA4/5 MOs is that it is unclear whether they
create an equivalent of a null mutation. Nevertheless, ourresults show that Xenopus embryos have a greater and ear-
lier requirement for GATA5 than for GATA4. A recentstudy by Peterkin et al, utilising translation-blocking MOsin Xenopus laevis has reported that GATA4 is required for
cardiac morphogenesis, but not for cardiac gene expres-
sion [34]. Whilst their conclusions on the role of GATA4
in morphogenesis are in broad agreement with our study,our work suggests that GATA4 MOs also affect cardiacgene expression. It is possible that this apparent discrep-ancy reflects the unknown effect of translation-blockingMOs on endogenous GATA4 protein. As in the case of
GATA5 stated above, the precise role of GATA4 in early
development of Xenopus and zebrafish will be better
defined when embryos lacking GATA4 become available.The role of GATA4 in heart and liver development in Xeno-
pus embryos revealed by our study appears to be in good
agreement with the results from zebrafish and mouseembryos [9,11,12,26,34]. GATA4 MOs frequently resultin embryos with cardia bifida (Fig. 4), a defect that alsocharacterises GATA4 null mouse embryos [5,7]. In themouse model, the cardia bifida phenotype is caused by
GATA4-defective extraembryonic endoderm [6]. It is of
note that in our Xenopus study specific downregulation of
GATA4 in anterior endoderm also affects heart morpho-genesis (Fig. 6). It is possible that these distinct forms ofendoderm may share signalling activities despite being ofdifferent embryological origin.
An additional conserved feature of the action of GATA4 in
development of heart and liver in Xenopus is its dose-
dependent interaction with GATA6, which has beenshown by genetic analyses of compound heterozygousmice and by MOs in zebrafish [12,38]. It is intriguing tospeculate that the mechanism of this genetic interaction
involves direct interaction and synergism of GATA4 and
GATA6 proteins, as suggested by in vitro studies [39].
Development of heart and liver and GATA factors
In our study we have assessed the roles of GATA4 andGATA5 in early heart and liver development. Remarkably,
the vast majority of morphants for either GATA factor dis-
played reduced or altered expression of both heart andliver markers. One implication of these results is that thedevelopment of heart and liver are closely linked. Inamniotes it has been shown that cardiac mesoderminduces liver fate in adjacent foregut endoderm [40,41],
and conversely, endoderm is required for cardiac morpho-
genesis, as revealed by GATA4 mutant mice [5-7]. Finally,work from Xenopus and chick models have established a
role for anterior endoderm, which is fated to become liver,in cardiac specification [42-44]. The fates of heart andliver appear to be closely intertwined through reciprocal
interactions and GATA factors may mediate at least some
of those. Our mosaic analyses of GATA4 and GATA5 func-tion suggests that they can act in anterior endoderm toaffect heart morphogenesis non-cell autonomously. Theseresults are in good agreement with the null phenotype ofGATA4 mice, which display heart defects caused by defi-ciency of GATA4 in endoderm [6]. More recent studies of
the function of GATA4 in the myocardium of the mouse
embryo have also demonstrated a later cell-autonomousrole in growth of the heart [9], and we anticipate a similarrole for Xenopus GATA4. However, given that the resolu-
tion of our experiments has been limited by the unknownefficacy of MOs targeted to a small part of the embryo, and
by difficulty in uniquely targeting cardiac precursors by
injections, better understanding of cell-specific role ofGATA factors in Xenopus will require genetic and trans-
genic approaches [45,46].

for in vivo  structure-function mapping
In this report we have shown that splice-site blocking
MOs can be used to study the role of C-terminal Zn fingerdomain of GATA4 and GATA5 in development. This waspossible because functional domains of GATA4 andGATA5 are encoded by distinct exons, and because for
both genes exons 3 and 5 are in the same coding frame.
Our results suggest that the C-terminal Zn finger DNAbinding domain is essential for the function of GATA4and GATA5 in heart and liver development. However, asthe C-terminal Zn finger of GATA4 also determines inter-actions with MADS box and Nkx2.5 binding partners
[47], the relative contribution of DNA- and protein-inter-
actions to the function of this domain in embryos is notclear at present.
Conclusion
The main finding of this work is that in Xenopus embryos
GATA5 plays an early, essential and dose-dependent role
in the development of the heart and liver. Downregula-
tion of GATA5 causes severe reduction in the number ofheart and liver precursors at the time of or shortly aftertheir specification. In addition, we have found that inXenopus GATA4 is required for heart and liver develop-
ment only later after their specification. These results have
confirmed and significantly extended previous studies on
the roles of GATA5 and GATA4 in early vertebrate devel-opment.
Methods
Xenopus  embryos and injections
Xenopus laevis embryos were obtained, cultured and
injected with capped mRNA, DNA, MOs and a mix ofrhodamine dextran and biotinylated dextran (InvitrogenUK) lineage tracer as described [36,48,49]. MOs were syn-thesized by Gene Tools, LLC (Oregon, USA). They wereresuspended in 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.6 followed by gel fil-
tration through Sephadex G-25 column (GE, UK). The
sequences of all new MOs used are given in AdditionalFile 1. GATA6 MO was previously described [14]. Injec-tions of G4/5 MOs have the same effect on heart and liverdevelopment when injected either uniformly or in theanterior part of the embryo at the 4- or 8-cell stage. X. trop-
icalis embryos were obtained and injected according to
http://tropicalis.berkeley.edu/home/
 and [50]. Treatment
with cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) and dexamethasone (2
μM; both from Sigma UK) in Fig. 4D was for 3 hours at
21°C.
Cell autonomy of GATA4 and GATA5 was examined by
injecting 2 nl of effective concentration of SP MOs (0.9
mg/ml for G5SP and 8 mg/ml for G4SP) in anterior-vege-tal blastomeres of 32/64 cell stage cardiac actin/GFP trans-genic embryos [33] together with rhodamine dextranlineage tracer. Embryos were viewed and imaged on Leica
MZ16F microscope with Leica DFC300 FX camera and
images were processed with Adobe Photoshop 6.
Luciferase reporter assays
1 ng of mRNA was injected with 30 pg each of 2XGATA-Luc [51] and TK-RL (Promega) and Dual Luciferase Assays
(Promega UK) were carried out on extracts from 20 ani-
mal caps per sample that were incubated for 3 hours afterexcision at st. 9.
Gene expression analyses
Whole mount in situ hybridisation (WMISH) was per-
formed as described [48] with the following probes: for
myocardium MLC2 [20] and cardiac Troponin I [21]; fortadpole liver primordia FOR1 [22] and Hex [23], for neu-rula/tailbud stage liver precursors Hex and for heart fieldNkx2.5 [28]. BCIP and BM purple alkaline phosphatasesubstrates (Roche) were used. After bleaching [48]injected biotinylated dextran was revealed using ExtrAvi-
din-AP and Fast Red substrate (Sigma UK). To avoid
under-representation of gene expression level that canoccur for the second probe in double WMISH, both heart->liver and liver->heart probe order of colour developmentin WMISH was used, together with a swap of more andless sensitive AP substrates.
RT-PCR. RNA was isolated [52] and cDNA was synthe-
sized with MMLV-RT according to manufacturer's recom-mendations (Promega UK). Primers for detection of thesplicing events caused by G5SP and G4SP MOs:G5forward 5'-CTACCCCTCTGTGGAGACGA, G5reverse
5'-TCGAGCCTGTGGAAGTCTTT, G4forward 5'-ATGT-
CAACCCCACTTTGGAG and G4reverse 5'-GAGCTGGTGGAAGGAGTGAG. Hexprimers: forward 5'-CTGCCATCTCCCAACTCACT and reverse 5'-CCTCTTCT-GTTCTGGAACCAGT. ODC (Orhithine Decarboxylase)primers: forward 5'-AACAAGCAGGCTGCTTCTGG and
reverse 5'-GGCTGGGTTTATCACAGATG. The PCR prod-
ucts were sized in comparison with a DNA marker (1 kb+,Invitrogen UK). The identity of wt (3–4–5) and spliced(3–5) GATA4 and GATA5 cDNAs were confirmed bysequencing, performed by the Molecular Biology Unit,Cardiff School of Biosciences.
Cloning of dGATA5
dGATA5a was cloned from Genbank L13701 DNA tem-plate [53] by PCR overlap method using Vent polymerase(NEB UK). In brief, the PCR product obtained usingSTART (5'-GACAGATCTGGTTTGTAGCACCGGAT-CATGT) and reverse (5'-ACGAGGCACCAGTCTTTTCTGT-
GGCTTGAT) primers was combined with the product
from the reaction using forward (5'-AGACTGGT-GCCTCGTCCTCTGGCCA) and STOP (5'-GCACTCGAGT-TAGGCAAGTGCCAGCGCGCACCA) primers. The

(page number not for citation purposes)resulting dGATA5a coding region was cloned into pCS2
vector and the sequence of the construct verified by DNA
sequencing.
Western blotting
20 animal caps per sample were collected at st. 10 andlysed in extraction buffer [54]. SDS-PAGE and Western
blotting were performed with rat anti-HA-HRP mono-
clonal antibody (Roche UK) at 1:2000 dilution and fol-lowing stripping, anti-Erk or -HSP70 antibodies (SigmaUK) were used to provide loading controls. Chemilumi-nescent signal detection and stripping were performedaccording to manufacturer's instructions (Perbio UK).
