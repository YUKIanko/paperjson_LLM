Several lines of evidence suggest that GATA6 has an integral role in controlling development of the
mammalian liver. Unfortunately, this proposal has been impossible to address directly because mouse embryoslacking GATA6 die during gastrulation. Here we show that the early embryonic deﬁciency associated withGATA6-knockout mice can be overcome by providing GATA6-null embryos with a wild-type extraembryonicendoderm with the use of tetraploid embryo complementation. Analysis of rescued Gata6
/H11546//H11546embryos revealed
that, although hepatic speciﬁcation occurs normally, the speciﬁed cells fail to differentiate and the liver bud
does not expand. Although GATA6 is expressed in multiple tissues that impact development of the liver,including the heart, septum transversum mesenchyme, and vasculature, all are relatively unaffected by loss ofGATA6, which is consistent with a cell-autonomous requirement for GATA6 during hepatogenesis. We alsodemonstrate that a closely related GATA factor, GATA4, is expressed transiently in the prehepatic endodermduring hepatic speciﬁcation and then lost during expansion of the hepatic primordium. Our data support theproposal that GATA4 and GATA6 are functionally redundant during hepatic speciﬁcation but that GATA6alone is available for liver bud growth and commitment of the endoderm to a hepatic cell fate.
In mice, hepatic development begins at the six- to eight-
somite stage of embryogenesis (E8.0) in response to inductivesignals from the heart and septum transversum, including ﬁ-broblast growth factors and bone morphogenetic proteins, aswell as the presence of endothelial cells (9, 15, 17, 24, 40, 45).In addition to growth factors, gene-targeting studies have im-plicated several transcription factors in controlling distinct as-pects of hepatogenesis (8–10). These include the homeoboxfactor Hex, which is necessary for morphogenesis and growthof the liver bud; Prox1, which is required for hepatoblast mi-gration; and HNF4, which is essential for hepatocyte differen-tiation and the epithelial transformation of the liver (1, 19, 22,23, 33, 41).
Molecular and genetic analyses have suggested that the
GATA factors may also act to control hepatogenesis (2, 36, 38,39, 44, 46, 47). The GATA family of zinc ﬁnger transcriptionfactors currently consists of six members in mammals (34).GATA1, -2, and -3 appear to act primarily in hematopoieticcells while GATA4, -5, and -6 are expressed in a diverse arrayof tissues (25). In vivo footprinting analyses of pluripotentembryonic gut endoderm revealed that GATA4 bound theAlbumin (Alb1 ) enhancer prior to the onset of albumin expres-
sion in the primary liver bud, implying a role for GATA4 inregulating the onset of hepatic mRNA expression (2, 3, 5, 7,15). Genetic evidence supporting a requirement for GATAfactors in development of the gastrointestinal tract and itsderivatives, including the liver, has emerged from studies withmultiple model systems: GATA5 has been implicated in gutand liver development in zebra ﬁsh (37, 38), END1 is required
for endoderm development in Caenorhabditis elegans (46, 47),
SERPENT is essential for gut development in Drosophila me-
lanogaster (36, 39), and GATA6 contributes to branching mor-
phogenesis of the lungs (18, 43).
Of the known GATA proteins, GATA6 is a particularly
appealing candidate for a factor that may contribute towardliver development because GATA6 regulates expression of thenuclear hormone receptor HNF4 (16, 22, 27, 33). Moreover,development of Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos arrests during gastrulation
with a phenotype that is very similar to that associated with
Hnf4/H11002//H11002embryos, which is consistent with GATA6 acting up -
stream of HNF4 during development (4, 20, 27). This early
embryonic lethality, which is believed to be a consequence ofextraembryonic endoderm dysfunction, has so far preventedthe use of Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos for any analyses of the role of
GATA6 during liver development. However, extraembryonic
endoderm deﬁciencies can be rescued by generating embryosfrom embryonic stem (ES) cells by using tetraploid embryocomplementation (12, 22). We therefore attempted to addresswhether GATA6 is required for hepatogenesis by generatingembryos from Gata6
/H11002//H11002ES cells by the tetraploid embryo
complementation approach. We found that Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-
derived embryos survive until E10.5, deﬁnitively demonstrating
that embryonic lethality in GATA6-knockout embryos is aconsequence of loss of GATA6 function in the extraembryonicendoderm as suggested previously (20, 27). Analyses of thedeveloping liver in these embryos show that GATA6 is dis-pensable for hepatic speciﬁcation but essential for liver budexpansion and for normal expression of hepatic mRNAs with-in the nascent hepatoblasts. We also examined heart, sep-tum transversum mesenchyme, and vascular development in

Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos because they are the source
of paracrine signals that are necessary for liver development.
In contrast to the liver, however, we found that developmentof these tissues is not signiﬁcantly affected by the absence ofGATA6.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Generation of targeted ES cell lines and embryos. Gata6/H11001//H11002and Gata6/H11002//H11002R1
ES cells were produced by standard procedures with a previously described
GATA6 targeting construct (26), shown in Fig. 1. All cells were conﬁrmed tohave the predicted genotype by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 1). Embryos weregenerated directly from ES cells by tetraploid embryo complementation as de-scribed previously (12, 29). Pregnant mare serum gonadotropin used in super-ovulation was obtained from A. F. Parlow at the National Hormone and PeptideProgram.
RT-PCR. Foregut endoderm was dissected from six- to eight-somite-stage
embryos and hearts were dissected from E9.5 embryos in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline under a dissecting microscope with tungsten needles. RNA wasprepared from individual samples with Qiagen’s RNeasy minikit and processedfor reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) as described previously (12).

In situ hybridization. Embryos were embedded in parafﬁn. Sections were cut
a t5t o7 /H9262m and were processed for in situ hybridization with
33P-labeled anti -
sense RNA probes as described elsewhere (11, 35). Digital dark-ﬁeld imageswere inverted and overlaid on bright-ﬁeld images by using Adobe Photoshop.Experimental and control images were processed identically in all cases.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraform-
aldehyde-ﬁxed parafﬁn sections as described previously (33) with a 1/500 dilutionof primary antibodies recognizing HNF4 (Santa Cruz, catalog no. sc-6556),GATA4 (Santa Cruz, catalog no. sc-1237), or platelet endothelial cell adhesionmolecule (PECAM; CD31; BD PharMingen).
RESULTS
Gata6/H11546//H11546ES cell-derived embryos complete gastrulation.
Development of Gata6/H11002//H11002embryos is blocked during gastru -
lation, and the embryos are unable to generate a fully differ-entiated extraembryonic endoderm (20, 27). In addition, theyfail to express mRNAs normally present in this endodermincluding Hnf4 (27). These data suggest that the early embry-
onic lethality associated with loss of GATA6 is a consequenceof defective extraembryonic endoderm function, as has previ-ously been demonstrated for Hnf4
/H11002//H11002embryos (12). Tetra -
ploid embryo complementation has been used successfully togenerate embryos from ES cells and to circumvent deﬁcienciesin the extraembryonic endoderm function (12, 29). In thisapproach, tetraploid embryos contribute cells to the extraem-bryonic endoderm while the fetus is derived solely from EScells (30). We therefore used this procedure to test whether thegastrulation arrest associated with the GATA6-null phenotypewas due to extraembryonic endoderm defects as suggestedby the analyses of Gata6 -knockout embryos (20, 27). A
Gata6
/H11002//H11002allele was generated in R1 ES cells according to the
same strategy used to produce Gata6 -knockout mice (27), and
Gata6/H11002//H11002cells were selected by growth of Gata6/H11001//H11002cells in a
high concentration of G418 (Fig. 1A) (28). The genotype of all
ES cells used in this study was conﬁrmed by Southern blotanalyses of genomic DNA (Fig. 1B). As presented in Fig. 2,post-gastrulation-stage E9.5 and E10.5 embryos could be pro-duced from both control Gata6
/H11001//H11002(n/H11005160) and experimental
Gata6/H11002//H11002(n/H11005180) ES cells, and embryos of both genotypes
exhibited characteristics of normal developmental patterning
(Fig. 2A). The genotype of embryos was conﬁrmed by PCRanalysis of genomic DNA. No wild-type Gata6 allele was de-
tected in fetuses derived from Gata6

C), which was expected because the Gata6/H11001//H11001tetraploid cells
contribute to the extraembryonic endoderm only in such chi-
meric embryos (12, 30). Although Gata6/H11001//H11002ES cell-derived
embryos developed normally through E11.5, by this same em-bryonic stage Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos lacked tissue
integrity and were readsorbing. The latest time point at which
living Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos could be recovered
was E10.5. While rescued Gata6/H11002//H11002embryos had clearly pro -
gressed through gastrulation, they were consistently smallerthan control embryos (Fig. 2A). However, although they wererelatively diminutive, the rate of development was indistin-guishable between control and experimental embryos; somitenumber, appearance of limb buds, heart looping, and neuraltube closure were the same between Gata6
/H11001//H11002andGata6/H11002//H11002
ES cell-derived embryos isolated at E9.5 and E10.5. The cause
of death or why Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos are smaller
has not been established. However, the extent of cell prolifer-
ation, determined by anti-phosphohistone H3 immunohisto-chemistry, was similar between Gata6
/H11001//H11002and Gata6/H11002//H11002ES
cell-derived embryos at E9.5 (data not shown). In addition, the
level of apoptotic cell death, determined by terminal deoxy-nucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end label-ing (TUNEL), was also generally similar between control andmutant embryos (data not shown). In some GATA6-null em-bryos (three of ﬁve) there appeared to be a qualitative increasein TUNEL positive staining around the region of the presump-tive liver bud compared to control embryos; however, thisincrease in TUNEL staining was variable, and we were unableto generate reproducible quantitative results. The ﬁnding thatE10.5 embryos can routinely be generated from Gata6
/H11002//H11002ES
cells by tetraploid embryo complementation while GATA6-
knockout embryos arrest during gastrulation deﬁnitively dem-onstrates that GATA6 expression is required in the extraem-bryonic endoderm to maintain an environment that supportsgastrulation of the epiblast.
Development of the liver is blocked at E9.5 in Gata6
/H11546//H11546ES
cell-derived embryos. To determine whether GATA6 was re-
quired for development of the liver, we compared formation ofthe liver bud in histological sections of embryos at E9.5 andE10.5 that were generated from Gata6
/H11001//H11002orGata6/H11002//H11002ES
cells. All analyses were performed on embryos with similar
numbers of somites to ensure that they were at equivalentdevelopmental stages—the appearance of new somite pairsoccurs approximately ever y2hi nt h e mouse and allows high-
resolution timing of the developmental stage of embryos be-tween E8.5 and E10.5. Figures 3A and C show that in controlembryos the liver bud could easily be identiﬁed by E9.5 as adistinct outgrowth of the ventral foregut and, by E10.5, thathepatoblasts had delaminated from the primary liver bud andhad migrated into the surrounding septum transversum mes-enchyme. In contrast to controls, development of the liver inGata6
/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos was severely perturbed. At
E9.5, the liver bud consisted of a small rudimentary outgrowth
of endoderm that had failed to expand by E10.5 (Fig. 3B andD). Indeed, at E10.5, the liver bud was virtually indiscernibleand there was no indication that the hepatoblasts had delami-nated from the foregut.
These data suggested that there was a failure in the ability of
the ventral endoderm to follow a normal hepatic developmen-tal program. To address this directly, control and mutant em-bryos were stained for expression of characteristic markers ofhepatic development. Figures 3E to H show that in situ hy-bridization analyses identiﬁed Alb1 mRNA within the devel-
oping liver of control embryos at E9.5 and E10.5 while in

mutant embryos Alb1 mRNA was undetectable. Previous work
had demonstrated that GATA6 regulates expression of thehepatocyte differentiation factor HNF4 (16, 27). As shown inFig. 3I, HNF4 protein can be identiﬁed, by immunohistochem-istry, in the nucleus of endodermal cells within the liver bud atE9.5. In Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos, however, although HNF4 can be
identiﬁed in the visceral endoderm that acts as a positive con-
trol for antibody staining, no expression of HNF4 is foundwithin the liver bud (Fig. 3J).
Immediately following inductive signaling from surrounding
tissues, the nascent hepatic cells initiate the process of differ-entiation. The onset of differentiation is rapid, and levels ofhepatic mRNAs increase quickly, which presumably reﬂectscommitment of the endoderm to a hepatic fate. Radioactive insitu hybridization, shown in Fig. 3K and M, shows that expres-sion of Hex mRNA, which encodes a homeobox transcription
factor essential for liver development, increases signiﬁcantlybetween 20 and 23 somites in control E9.5 embryos (1, 19, 23).In contrast, although HexmRNA could be detected in Gata6
/H11002//H11002
ES cell-derived embryos, the level was lower than that seen
in controls, and moreover, between 20 and 23 somites Hex
mRNA levels failed to increase in the absence of GATA6 (Fig.3L and N). The fact that albumin and HNF4 were undetectableand that Hex mRNAs failed to increase in GATA6-null em-
bryos demonstrates that GATA6 is required for the liver bud to
mature and commit to a normal hepatic developmental pro-gram.
Hepatic speciﬁcation occurs in Gata6
/H11546//H11546ventral endoderm.
The ﬁnding that Hex mRNA was present in the endoderm of
Gata6/H11002//H11002embryos suggested that hepatic development had
been induced within the ventral foregut. However, HexmRNA
is also expressed in the developing ventral pancreas, and so itseemed possible that the identiﬁcation of Hex transcripts re-
ﬂected development of the pancreas rather than liver. To de-ﬁnitively address whether hepatic speciﬁcation had occurred inthe absence of GATA6, we determined the extent of liver geneexpression in ventral endoderm isolated from experimentaland control E8.0 embryos containing six to eight somite pairsby RT-PCR. It is at this developmental stage that inductivecues acting on the endoderm specify hepatic cell fate (15).Figure 4A shows that, as expected, Gata6 mRNA could be
detected by RT-PCR in control ventral endoderm but was notdetected in Gata6
/H11002//H11002endoderm. Importantly, this result con -
ﬁrmed the absence of any GATA6-positive tetraploid embryo-derived extraembryonic endoderm, which could potentiallyconfound the analysis. Examination of steady-state levels ofmRNAs encoding alpha-fetoprotein (Afp), albumin, HNF4,retinol binding protein (Rbp4), and transthyretin (Ttr), all ofwhich are expressed in hepatoblasts, revealed that all wereidentiﬁed at comparable levels between control and Gata6

ventral endoderm isolates. The fact that AlbmRNA could be
detected by RT-PCR in the ventral endoderm of E8.0Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos but not by in situ hybridization at E9.5
likely reﬂects the relative sensitivity of the two assays. These
data show that GATA6 is dispensable for hepatic speciﬁcationand that Gata6
/H11002//H11002ventral endoderm is competent to initiate a
program of liver gene expression.
Given the clear absence of liver development at E9.5, the
ﬁnding that expression of hepatic mRNAs within the ventralendoderm during the earliest stages of liver development(E8.5) was unaffected by loss of GATA6 seemed surprising.GATA factors, however, have similar DNA binding character-istics, and both GATA6 and GATA4 are expressed in endo-derm-derived tissues, suggesting that they may functionallyoverlap (26, 31). We therefore tested whether GATA4 waspresent in the ventral endoderm of embryos lacking GATA6during hepatic speciﬁcation. Figure 4B shows that GATA4 wasindeed detected by immunohistochemistry in the presumptivehepatic ventral endoderm of both control and Gata6
/H11002//H11002E8.5
ES cell-derived embryos containing 8 to 10 somites, suggesting
that GATA4 has the potential to compensate for loss ofGATA6 during hepatic speciﬁcation.
GATA4 is transiently expressed in the early ventral endo-
derm and may complement loss of GATA6 during hepaticspeciﬁcation. If GATA4 and GATA6 have redundant roles in
controlling liver gene expression during hepatic speciﬁcation, itraises the question of why GATA4 is apparently unable tocompensate for loss of GATA6 during later stages of hepaticdevelopment at E9.5 when the liver bud is expanding. With thisin mind we examined expression of GATA4 and GATA6 inembryos containing 12 somites (E8.5), which had just com-pleted hepatic speciﬁcation, and in embryos containing 25somites, in which hepatoblasts were migrating from the ex-panding liver bud. Figures 5A, C, E, G, and I show that, by 12
somites, GATA4 and -6 continue to be expressed in the spec-iﬁed hepatic endoderm of the liver bud as well as in the sur-rounding septum transversum mesenchyme. By 25 somitesGata6 mRNA was identiﬁed in the expanding hepatoblast
cells, although at levels lower than those found in the septumtransversum (Fig. 5B, D, and F). This is consistent with previ-ously published immunostaining data that show GATA6 pro-tein also present in hepatoblasts of E14.5 livers (31). However,strikingly and in contrast to Gata6 , GATA4 expression is
abruptly extinguished in hepatoblasts as the cells delaminatefrom the speciﬁed hepatic endoderm coincident with the stageat which loss of GATA6 results in a hepatic phenotype (Fig.5H and J). This low to undetectable expression of GATA4 inhepatic parenchymal cells is also seen in adult livers. Figures5K and L show that expression of GATA4 is most predominantin the endothelial cells surrounding the sinusoidal capillariesand large veins of the adult liver and in contrast is difﬁcult todetect by immunohistochemistry in the hepatocytes. In situhybridization studies showed that Gata4 mRNA was also un-
detectable in hepatoblasts in embryos at E9.5 (data notshown), suggesting that regulation was likely at the level oftranscription. This dynamic expression of GATA4 in the earlyventral endoderm is consistent with the proposal that GATA4and GATA6 have redundant functions during hepatic speciﬁ-cation but that only GATA6 is available to control expansionof the liver bud and commitment of hepatoblasts to express thenormal proﬁle of hepatic mRNAs.
GATA6 is dispensable for early development of the vascu-
lature, septum transversum, and heart. A combination of ge-
netic and molecular analyses has identiﬁed the developingheart, septum transversum mesenchyme, and vascular tissue assources of signals required for speciﬁcation and expansion of

control, and omission of reverse transcriptase from the RT-PCR and ampliﬁcations lacking template (lane 1) conﬁrmed the absence of

the hepatic primordium in mice (21). Many of these tissues
also express GATA6, raising the possibility that the block indevelopment of the liver in the absence of GATA6 could becaused by defective development of these nonhepatic tissues.Figures 6A to D show immunohistochemical staining of con-trol and Gata6
/H11002//H11002E9.5 ES cell-derived embryos for PECAM,
which is expressed in endothelial cells, and for GATA4, which
is highly expressed in the septum transversum mesenchyme atthe level of the liver bud. Both endothelial cells and septumtransversum mesenchyme were seen to surround the hepatic
bud regardless of GATA6’s presence or absence. The ﬁndingthat septum transversum mesenchyme was still present in theabsence of GATA6 was interesting given that we had previ-ously shown that Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos fail to form septum
transversum mesenchyme as well as the related proepicar-
dium (42).
It has also been proposed that the GATA factors have cru-
cial roles in controlling cardiac development (32). Since car-
FIG. 5. Expression of GATA4 but not GATA6 is extinguished in migrating hepatoblasts. Embryos containing 12 (A, C, E, G, and I) or 25 (B,
D, F, H, and J) somite pairs and adult livers (K and L) were isolated and processed for in situ hybridization to detect Gata6 mRNA (A to F) or
for immunohistochemistry to detect GATA4 protein (G to L). Both GATA4 protein (brown nuclear staining; G and I) and Gata6 mRNA (A, C,
and E) can be detected in the septum transversum mesenchyme (arrowheads) and liver bud (arrows) of 12-somite-pair embryos. At 25 somite pairs,Gata6 mRNA and GATA4 protein were detected in septum transversum mesenchyme (arrowheads; B, D, F, H, and J). In the liver bud (arrows;
B, D, F, H, and J), however, the presence of Gata6 mRNA could be identiﬁed but GATA4 protein was undetectable. GATA4 protein was also
detected predominantly in the endothelial cells (arrows) but not in hepatocytes (arrowheads) of adult livers (K and L). Panels E, F, I, J, and L showhigh-resolution images of boxed areas in panels C, D, G, H, and K, respectively. Both bright-ﬁeld (A and B) and corresponding dark-ﬁeld (C toF) images of Gata6 in situ hybridization analyses are presented. The presence of mRNA can be detected as bright silver grains in dark-ﬁeld images;

diogenesis is essential for liver development, we determined
whether development of the heart was affected by loss ofGATA6. Figures 6E and F show hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections through the cardiac region of E9.5 control andGata6
/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos. Both embryos appeared to
have developed comparably, containing differentiated cardio-
myocytes and endocardial cells. In a minority of cases, theextent of ventricular trabeculation was subtly reduced in theabsence of GATA6; however, many Gata6
/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived
embryos appeared normal in this regard. The role of GATA
factors in controlling cardiac gene expression has been studiedintensely, and so we compared steady-state levels of severalcardiomyocyte mRNAs by RT-PCR in hearts isolated fromE9.5 embryos. As shown in Fig. 6I, expression of all cardiacmRNAs was similar in both control and Gata6
/H11002//H11002ES cell-
derived hearts. Importantly, these mRNAs included those en-coding Fgf1, Bmp2, and Bmp4, which have previously been
shown to regulate development of the liver (17, 40). The ob-servation that cardiac gene expression was unaffected by loss ofGATA6 could be due to maintenance of GATA4 expressionin the Gata6
/H11002//H11002cardiomyocytes. In support of GATA4 and
GATA6 having redundant functions in the heart, GATA4 pro-
tein could indeed be detected in Gata6/H11002//H11002cardiomyocytes by
immunohistochemistry, and Gata4 mRNA was identiﬁed in
GATA6-null hearts by RT-PCR (Fig. 6G to I).
DISCUSSION
Our production of post-gastrulation-stage embryos from
Gata6/H11002//H11002ES cells, through tetraploid embryo complementa -
tion, deﬁnitively establishes that GATA6-knockout mice arrestduring early embryonic development due to defects in ex-

traembryonic endoderm function as was proposed previously
(20, 27). A direct role for GATA6 acting as a regulator ofextraembryonic endoderm development is also supported byloss-of-function studies of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells. Inthese experiments, the ability of F9 cells to form parietal en-doderm in culture was suppressed when expression of GATA4and GATA6 was simultaneously reduced using a short inter-fering RNA approach (14). In addition, forced expression ofGATA6 in ES cells induced these pluripotent cells to adopt anextraembryonic endoderm fate (13). Together these resultsconvincingly argue that GATA6 is a central regulator of ex-traembryonic endoderm differentiation.
The availability of Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos that develop to E10.5
has also allowed us to demonstrate an essential role for
GATA6 in controlling development of the mammalian liver.Although analysis of cell-type-speciﬁc knockouts of GATA6will be necessary to deﬁnitively establish whether this factoracts cell autonomously during hepatogenesis, the observationthat development of the heart, septum transversum, and em-bryonic vasculature appears relatively normal in Gata6
/H11002//H11002em-
bryos is consistent with GATA6 acting within the endoderm.Molecular and biochemical studies also support a cell-auton-omous role for GATA factors in controlling liver development.Analyses of the Albumin gene’s transcriptional regulatory ele-
ments have uncovered several transcription factors that appearto have roles in hepatic development (2, 15). Of these factors,FoxA and GATA4 have been shown to interact with the Al-
bumin enhancer in pluripotent deﬁnitive endoderm prior to
the onset of Albumin gene expression and hepatic speciﬁcation
(15). GATA4 and FoxA are unusual in that they can recognizetheir respective binding sites and form stable complexes in thecontext of compacted chromatin, which is normally recalcitrantto transcription factor binding (5, 7). Importantly, binding ofeither FoxA or GATA4 opens compacted chromatin, andFoxA appears to have the capacity to reposition nucleosomesaround the Albumin enhancer (5, 7). Based on these observa-
tions, it has been proposed that FoxA and GATA4 may actas potentiators of endodermal differentiation (44). In thisscheme, binding of these factors would remodel local areas ofchromatin around the transcriptional regulatory elements ofliver genes in the pluripotent endoderm, rendering them ca-pable of binding transcriptional activators. This would main-tain these genes in a competent but inactive state. If transcrip-tional activators were induced in response to inductive signals,they would then have access to the transcriptionally competentgenes and initiate differentiation through activation of geneexpression. Most of the studies that have led to this model havefocused on GATA4 as the factor that acts in conjunction withFoxA to mediate hepatic competency of the endoderm (5–7).However, GATA binding sites can be recognized by GATA4,-5, and -6, suggesting that any of these could potentially act aspioneer factors.
Our data show that, as development proceeds, GATA6
alone is necessary for expansion of the liver bud and commit-ment of the endoderm to a hepatic cell fate. However, basedon the ﬁnding that hepatic mRNA expression is unaltered inthe absence of GATA6 in E8.5 embryos containing six to eightsomites, hepatic speciﬁcation of Gata6
/H11002//H11002ventral endoderm
appears to be intact. This may seem surprising given the com-
pelling molecular evidence that supports a role for the GATAfactors in regulating competency and, as a consequence, he-
patic speciﬁcation. However, examination of the expression ofGATA4 within the endoderm of both wild-type and Gata6
/H11002//H11002
embryos offers a possible explanation of why GATA6 is dis-
pensable for hepatic speciﬁcation. We have demonstrated thatGATA4 can be detected in the ventral endoderm prior tospeciﬁcation of the hepatic lineage. This expression continueswithin the presumptive nascent hepatic cells until the 12- to14-somite stage of development ( /H11011E9.0). However, after this
developmental time point GATA4 is rapidly lost from the cellswithin the nascent hepatic endoderm as the liver bud expands,although expression remains within dorsal domains of the fo-regut. In contrast to GATA4, Gata6 mRNA can be detected
within the presumptive hepatic endoderm throughout theseearly stages of hepatogenesis. Based on these analyses we spec-ulate that GATA4 compensates for loss of GATA6 duringhepatic speciﬁcation but that GATA6 alone is present to con-trol subsequent stages of hepatic development. These resultsalso suggest that GATA factors not only act during compe-tency and speciﬁcation stages but continue to be required asthe liver bud is expanding. These proposals may ultimately beanswered by the generation of embryos lacking both GATA4and GATA6.
In addition to regulating development of the liver, GATA6
has also been implicated in heart development (32). Our stud-ies of rescued GATA6-null embryos revealed at most onlysubtle changes in cardiac morphology; in some embryos for-mation of trabeculae within the developing ventricular regionsappeared to be slightly reduced compared to controls. Al-though these data show that GATA6 is dispensable for earlyheart formation, it is possible that GATA6 is required for somephysiological aspects of fetal cardiovascular function, whichcould conceivably explain the relatively small size of GATA6-null embryos. GATA4 is also expressed in the developingheart, and we have previously reported that GATA4-null em-bryos have an extremely thin ventricular myocardium and com-plete absence of the proepicardium (42). This did not appearto be the case for Gata6
/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos in which
development of both proepicardium and myocardium was gen-
erally indistinguishable from control embryos. In addition,as was the case for Gata4
/H11002//H11002embryos, GATA6-null embryos
presented no alteration in cardiac gene expression, including
expression of GATA4. Comparing the phenotypes presentedbyGata4
/H11002//H11002andGata6/H11002//H11002ES cell-derived embryos, it is clear
that the relationship between GATA4, GATA6, and their reg-
ulation of development is complex; in some cases, for examplein hepatic speciﬁcation and cardiac gene expression, thereappears to be redundancy in function between GATA4 andGATA6, while in others, for example in development of theseptum transversum and proepicardium, one factor appears tohave a dominant role. Whether these factors act in a redundantor nonredundant manner may be explained by subtle differ-ences in the timing of expression of the two factors in a giventissue during development or by differences in the binding ofGATA4 and GATA6 to speciﬁc partners, such as Fog proteinsand other coactivators. At the moment these issues are difﬁcultto address; however, they may be resolved in the future by theavailability of conditional alleles or by the use of speciﬁc shortinterfering RNAs.
In summary, we have demonstrated that providing Gata6
/H11002//H11002VOL. 25, 2005 GATA6 IN LIVER DEVELOPMENT 2629
embryos with a wild-type extraembryonic endoderm allows
these embryos to proceed through gastrulation. Examinationof these rescued Gata6
/H11002//H11002embryos reveals that, although they
are smaller, development of many tissues occurs normally, with
the exception of the liver, which arrests shortly after formationof the primary hepatic bud. While several transcription factorshave been shown to inﬂuence hepatocyte differentiation andmaturation of the liver, GATA6 can now be classiﬁed as oneof a very few that are essential for the earliest stages of he-patic development. The future challenges that arise fromthis study clearly include deﬁning the molecular mechanismsthrough which GATA6 controls development of the hepaticprimordium.
