Abstract
Analysis of gene function in vertebrates is facilitated by gain-of-function studies, such as injection of synthetic mRNA in amphibian
embryos. This approach is hampered by lack of spatial and temporal control of expression of the introduced gene product. An additional levelof control is obtained by nuclear-transfer-mediated transgenesis, but functional analyses are complicated by variability and background
abnormalities in primary transgenic embryos. The GAL4/UAS system permits establishment of stable lines and elimination of nuclear-
transfer-associated abnormalities, through generation of separate UAS-‘effector’ and GAL4 ‘transactivator’ transgenic lines. When theGAL4 DNA-binding domain is combined with a steroid hormone ligand-binding domain, this system allows full temporal regulation of
transgene expression by introduction of an exogenous steroid analogue, the progesterone antagonist RU486. We show here that by crossing
stable Xenopus tropicalis transgenic lines, one bearing a UAS-enhanced cyan ﬂuorescent protein (ECFP) reporter construct, and the other
with a GAL4–progesterone receptor fusion driven by a retina-speciﬁc promoter, reporter expression in the resulting embryos can be induced
with RU486 in a tissue-speciﬁc manner. These results suggest that the inducible binary system, in which the target gene expression can be
controlled in a stage- and tissue-speciﬁc pattern, should be readily applicable for gene function studies at all stages of development. q2002

1. Introduction
InXenopus studies, over- or misexpression of a gene
product by mRNA injection is the most common way toanalyze the function of a cloned gene (e.g. Smith andHarland, 1991). However, misexpression-associated pleio-
tropy or lethality often masks analysis of later developmen-
tal processes. The recently developed frog transgenesistechnique (Kroll and Amaya, 1996; Ofﬁeld et al., 2000)permits the expression of a gene product in a tissue-speciﬁcmanner by delivering the gene product under the control of adeﬁned promoter (Hartley et al., 2001). Analysis of theconsequences of transgene expression in primary trans-genics is, however, often complicated by position effects,
variability in expression levels, and background abnormal-
ities associated with nuclear transfer. These problems can becircumvented by establishing stable transgenic lines, butonly where transgene expression is non-lethal.To overcome these difﬁculties, we have applied the
GAL4/UAS system extensively utilized in the ﬂy (Brandand Perrimon, 1993). This system divides the target gene
(UAS-effector) from transcriptional activation elements
(GAL4 transactivator) in two separate transgenic lines. Inan effector line the target gene, under the control of GAL4binding sites (
Upstream Activation Sequences) remains
silent in the absence of its activator GAL4, ensuring thatthese transgenic founders are viable. Only in the progeny ofa cross of a UAS-effector line to a GAL4 transactivator lineis the target gene expressed. This system can also provide an
additional level of temporal control of transgene expression
by fusing the GAL4 binding domain with a steroid receptorligand-binding domain (Wang et al., 1994).
In this study, we tested the GAL4/UAS system in the
pipid frog Xenopus tropicalis , which has emerged as a
complementary system to its close relative, Xenopus laevis
(Amaya et al., 1998). X.tropicalis shares many of the
advantages of X.laevis , but is more suited for multigenera-
tion genetic experiments by virtue of its short generation
time and smaller diploid genome.
Here we show that, using the transgenic activator and
effector lines we established, the expression of UAS-targetMechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235–241

2. Results
2.1. Injected GAL4 RNA activates the transcription of
transgenic UAS effector gene
We have generated X.tropicalis effector lines carrying a
UAS –ECFP construct, in which the gene for a green ﬂuor-
escent protein (GFP) variant, ECFP (Clontech), is under thecontrol of GAL4 binding motifs. This construct alsocontains a second reporter cassette (pCAR –RFP) with the

expression in the somites (Kroll and Amaya, 1996; Hartley
et al., 2001) to identify embryos carrying the transgene (Fig.
1A).
To establish the utility of the UAS –ECFP line we ﬁrst
tested whether exogenous GAL4 can activate transcriptionin stable UAS –ECFP transgenic embryos by transient
expression assays. A male transgenic founder was crossedwith a wild-type female, and resulting embryos were theninjected in one blastomere with 1 or 10 pg of synthetic
GAL4 mRNA at the two-cell stage (Fig. 1A). A substantial
difference in response to the two doses of GAL4 mRNA inJ. Chae et al. / Mechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235–241 236

activation of the effector gene was detected by observing
ECFP expression in the injected side of embryos at laterstages (Fig. 1B,F). This unilateral ECFP expression wasparticularly obvious in enlarged dorsal view images ofstage 45 embryos injected with 10 pg of GAL4 mRNA
(Fig. 1C –E). Strong RFP expression in somitic muscle
driven by the second cassette at stage 45 (Nieuwkoop andFaber, 1967) enabled us to con ﬁrm the stable transmission
of the transgene through the germline and to select RFP-positive embryos carrying the UAS-target to assay its acti-vation by injected GAL4 (Fig. 1F). ECFP expression wasseen in 55% (21 out of 38) or 95% (19 out of 20) of RFP-positive embryos injected with 1 or 10 pg of GAL4 mRNA,
respectively. Uninjected RFP-positive embryos showed no
visually-detectable ECFP expression (0 out of 10). Noexpression was observed following the injection of anydose of GAL4 into RFP-negative embryos that have notarget gene to activate (data not shown).
The F1 animals derived from the transgenic UAS –ECFP
founder used for GAL4 RNA injections were raised tomaturity and found to contain two different UAS –ECFP
inserts in subsequent analyses. DNA from F1 animals was
analyzed by genomic Southern blotting, and they showedhybridization patterns which indicate that they carry one oftwo transgenic loci in their founder (data not shown).
Although ECFP was not detected by ﬂuorescence in the
untreated UAS lines, the two F1 populations with distinctSouthern patterns were further evaluated for backgroundexpression of ECFP by Western blotting, and one was
found to have detectable background by this method. Each
group of F1 animals was outcrossed and resulting embryoswere subjected to Western analysis. A correlation betweenSouthern patterns and background expression of ECFP wasthereby revealed; one group showed little background whilethe other group showed a detectable level of background(data not shown). The low background line was used in
subsequent experiments.
2.2. Rx promoter –GFP reporter expression in transgenic X.
tropicalis lines
For the GAL4 transactivator line, we chose to target
expression to the retina using the promoter from the homeo-box gene Rx(Mathers et al., 1997). X.laevis Rx has been
reported to be expressed primarily in the primordia of the
retina. A 2.2 kb 5
0-upstream region of the Rxgene was
obtained by screening a X.tropicalis genomic library with
aX.laevis Rx cDNA probe. In order to con ﬁrm that this
promoter sequence could direct expression to the develop-ing retina, we generated transgenic lines with GFP fuseddownstream of the 2.2 kb Rxpromoter (pRx –GFP) and
analyzed the F1 embryos for the GFP expression pattern.
Strong GFP expression was seen ﬁrst in the anterior of
neural fold stage embryos, and was subsequently localizedto the two ﬁelds that give rise to the retina (Fig. 2A,B). At
later stages, the retina remains the primary site of GFPexpression in the pRx –GFP transgenic embryos (Fig. 2C –
E). The same promoter sequence that has the upstreamregion important for Rxexpression in the retina was utilized
to direct the expression of chimeric GAL4 in the activator
lines. An advantage of the use of this eye-speci ﬁc promoter
is the relative ease of assaying the activation of effector invivo by being able to identify embryos showing ﬂuores-
cence because it is visible externally.
2.3. Inducible chimeric GAL4 activates UAS-target in the
presence of RU486
To add the dimension of temporal regulation of target
gene expression, we utilized a chimeric transactivator,GALPR, constructed by fusing the GAL4 DNA bindingJ. Chae et al. / Mechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235 –241 237

domain to a mutated human progesterone receptor ligand
binding domain and the VP16 transcriptional activation
domain (Fig. 3A) (Wang et al., 1994). Upon binding tosynthetic progesterone analogue, RU486, this fusion proteinescapes cytoplasmic sequestration, travels to the nucleus,and binds UAS sequences, resulting in ef ﬁcient ligand-indu-
cible transactivation of target genes in cell culture and trans-genic mouse models (Wang et al., 1997; Burcin et al., 1998;Zhao et al., 2001). To establish transgenic X.tropicalis lines
with retina-speci ﬁc expression of this chimeric transactiva-
tor, we generated frogs bearing the Rxpromoter driving the
GALPR construct (pRx-GALPR). Next, we asked whetherthe chimeric GAL4 activates the transcription of UAS-target in the progeny of the cross of the two lines (Fig.3A). The pRx –GALPR transactivator line was crossed
with UAS –ECFP effector frogs (Fig. 3A) and the progeny
cultured with or without RU486 from stage 22 onward (Fig.
3B). Each of the lines in this cross is hemizygous for a
transgenic locus, producing four different genotypes: non-transgenic embryos, embryos bearing one transgene (either
the effector or transactivator gene), and embryos bearing
both effector and transactivator transgenes. Approximately50% of the progeny expressed RFP in the somites, indicat-ing that they carry a single locus bearing the UAS –effector
construct. Effector gene expression was analyzed either bymicroscopic examination for ECFP ﬂuorescence in the eye
or by Western analysis of eye extracts with an EGFP anti-body that crossreacts with ECFP (Clontech). The expression
of the ECFP in the effector construct is highly localized in
the retina and increases in a dose-dependent manner afterRU486 treatment in embryos carrying both effector andtransactivator genes. This result can be seen in a qualitativeway in the series of ﬂuorescent images in Fig. 3B, which
illustrates embryos 30 and 45 h after treatment. Table 1summarizes data from embryos carrying the effector trans-gene treated with 0, 5 and 25 nM RU486, showing that both
the fraction of embryos expressing ECFP, and their level of
expression, increases with increasing dose of RU486.J. Chae et al. / Mechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235 –241 238

which the Rxpromoter drives a chimeric transactivator gene (GAL4 DNA-binding domain, fused to a herpes virus VP16 transcriptional activation domain, in
turn fused to a modi ﬁed progesterone receptor ligand-binding domain). In the double-transgenic progeny, transcription of the UAS –ECFP reporter cassette is
activated only when the synthetic ligand RU486 is present, relieving the cytoplasmic sequestration of the GALPR transactivator protein. (B) Repres entative
embryos from this cross, treated with 0, 5, or 25 nM RU486 from stage 22 onwards for 30 h (bottom panels) or 45 h (top panels). ECFP expression was observedonly in RFP-positive embryos. (C) Western blot analysis of eye extract from embryos shown in (B) using EGFP antibody and anti-actin antibody. A pool of 30
RFP-positive or RFP-negative embryos at each dose of RU486 was assayed in each lane. (D) Western blot band intensities are quanti ﬁed by densitometry, and
relative levels of ECFP expression are calculated by normalizing to actin levels.
Western blot analysis of dissected eye tissue (Fig. 3C,D)
shows that the level of expression of ECFP in treatedembryos depends in a quantitative way on the dose of
RU486. ECFP expression was minimal in the absence of
RU486, as assayed by ECFP ﬂuorescence or Western analy-
sis (Table 1 and Fig. 3B –D, and data not shown), suggesting
that this system is not affected by endogenous froghormones. We also found that elevated ECFP ﬂuorescence
45 h postincubation (Fig. 3B, top panels) returned to base-line in some embryos after RU486 was removed fromculture media though others still showed signi ﬁcant ﬂuores-
cence after 2 days of withdrawal (data not shown). While
the decay of the reporter gene activity was slow, it appearsthat the target gene induction is reversible. We conclude thatthis inducible regulatory system works ef ﬁciently in X.
tropicalis .
3. Discussion
In this study, we have evaluated the utility of a GAL4/
UAS system in Xenopus tropicalis . In the stable transgenic
activator and effector lines we established, transgenic GAL4efﬁciently activates the transcription of a reporter gene in
the cells where it is expressed. Development of a GAL4/UAS method for targeted gene expression in the X.tropica-
lissystem is desirable for several reasons. First, the signi ﬁ-
cantly shorter generation time of X.tropicalis ,3–5 months,
allows rapid production and expansion of stable GAL4 andUAS transgenic lines at a relatively low cost. Second, theefﬁciency of in vivo promoter analysis in transgenic Xeno-
pus(Ofﬁeld et al., 2000) is resulting in an accumulation of
deﬁned promoters. These promoters, when combined with
GAL4, provide very useful tools for expressing combina-
tions of effector constructs in analysis of a wide variety of
developmental processes. Third, the GAL4/UAS system hasmany potential applications for gene function studies(Phelps and Brand, 1998). For example, this method may
be used to produce loss-of-function phenotypes by drivingthe expression of a gene variant that will antagonize theendogenous gene product. This is highly desirable becausecurrently there is no technique for targeted gene disruption
inXenopus .
In addition to showing the utility of a GAL4/UAS system
inXenopus for spatial regulation of transgenic constructs,
we also have used the construct to achieve the potential fortemporal control of gene expression. A ligand-inducibleregulatory system based on a mutated progesterone receptorligand binding domain has been shown to work in adultmouse cells and organs (Wang et al., 1997; Zhao et al.,
2001). We show here that this inducible system can be
used to study early embryonic development. We demon-strated that this system regulates gene expression in vivoinX.tropicalis embryos in response to RU486. We observed
that embryos cultured in 25 nM of RU486 showed a stronginduction of the target gene with no observable develop-mental defects (data not shown). We should mention thatthe induction is possible at concentrations that are signi ﬁ-
cantly lower than the micromolar range required to antag-
onize progesterone (Wang et al., 1994). Therefore, RU486treatment is unlikely to affect this endogenous hormonesystem.
While rapid kinetics of induction are a desirable aspect of
any inducible system, we observed a delay in target geneinduction, with ECFP ﬂuorescence ﬁrst detected 17 h post-
incubation in RU486. However, it has been reported that
detectable protein ﬂuorescence lags behind the onset of
UAS –GFP gene transcription, possibly due to post-transla-
tional modi ﬁcation and folding (Brand, 1995; Phelps and
Brand, 1998). Consistent with this, maturation of EGFP(Clontech) takes about 8 –9hi n Xenopus when tested by
microinjection of EGFP mRNA into 2 –4 cell embryos
(Zaraisky, A., personal communication). Considering thatthe concentration of mRNA transcribed from the transgene
is, in general, lower than that used in microinjection, the
time lag for ECFP accumulation to detectable levels wouldbe expected to be considerably longer than 8 –9 h. We might
expect that induction of other genes used in applications ofthis system would be substantially faster than that of ECFPshown here.
For the applications usually requiring robust transgene
expression such as the gene perturbation assays mentioned
earlier, further modulation of induction rapidity and expres-
sion level of the effector transgene could be achieved inseveral ways. First, one can make transgenic lines withvery high numbers of inserts (e.g. 30 –40 copies) in the
Xenopus system, either for the effector or transactivator,
or both. One could also increase the number of GAL4 bind-ing sites upstream of the target gene (Brand and Perrimon,1993; R ørth, 1996). In addition, one could insert 5
0or 30
UTR sequences that would stabilize the transcript from the
transgene (Rupp et al., 1994; Turner and Weintraub, 1994).Functional inhibition of some gene products, such as home-J. Chae et al. / Mechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235 –241 239

aEmbryos from the cross of the pRx-GALPR activator line with the

for ECFP expression. Each of 50 embryos carrying the effector gene (i.e.RFP-positive) cultured in 0 (solvent control), 5, or 25 nM of RU486,
respectively was scored as strongly ECFP-positive ( 11 ), weakly ECFP-
positive ( 1) or ECFP-negative ( 2). At the higher dose of RU486, the
fraction of embryos expressing ECFP approaches the expected maximum
level of 50%, i.e. the fraction of embryos expected to carry both activator
and effector transgenes. Effector-negative embryos (i.e. RFP-negative)were also analyzed for ECFP expression in the same way and showed nodetectable ECFP expression.
odomain transcription factors including Pax6 and Otx
homologs, Crx and SpOtx2, may not require very highlevels of overexpression of dominant-negative mutantsand therefore the expression level of mutant effector trans-gene producing the phenotype would be readily reached by
the method described here. These genes have been shown to
be repressed effectively by dominant-inhibitory variants atconcentrations lower than those of wild-type products(Singh et al., 1998; Furukawa et al., 1997; Li et al., 1999).
While culturing embryos with RU486 at stage 22 resulted
in 14-fold induction of target gene expression, we also trea-ted with RU486 at stage 41 onward and observed compar-able activation of ECFP expression (data not shown). This
suggests that this system can overcome a major limitation of
RNA expression studies in Xenopus , that the instability of
RNA prevents analysis of its effects on later stages, and maybe used to express effector transgenes at all stages of devel-opment, facilitating analysis of genes that function both inearly embryogenesis and later developmental processessuch as organogenesis.
3.1. Note
While preparing this paper, we learned of relevant studies
using ﬂy and X.laevis that have now been published by
other groups (Osterwalder et al., 2001; Roman et al.,2001; Hartley et al., 2002).
4. Experimental procedures
4.1. DNA constructs and generation of transgenic lines
A 2.2 kb 5
0-upstream region of the Rxgene was obtained
by screening a Lambda FIX-II Xenopus tropicalis genomic
library (constructed by Lisa Brunet and Richard Harland)with a Xenopus laevis Rx cDNA probe containing the 5
0
untranslated region. The pRx –GFP construct was generated
by subcloning this 2.2 kb region of the X.tropicalis Rx
promoter into pEGFP-1 vector (Clontech). This constructwas linearized with AﬂII for making transgenic animals.
The pRx –GALPR activator construct was generated by
deleting an Asp718 –NotI/blunt fragment containing the
EGFP coding sequences in pRx –GFP, and replacing them
with an Asp718 –BamHI/blunt fragment containing the
chimeric GAL4-VP16-mutant progesterone receptor
ligand-binding domain isolated from pGL-VP (Wang et al.,
1994). To construct the bifunctional UAS –ECFP plasmid,
the cardiac actin promoter in pCARGFP (gift of E. Amaya)(Kroll and Amaya, 1996) was removed and cloned into plas-mid pDsRed1 (Clontech), creating pCAR –RFP construct. An
AﬂII fragment of the resulting construct containing the CAR –
RFP cassette then was inserted into plasmid pECFP-1 (Clon-tech), resulting in double color reporter pBicolor in which the
expression of RFP is driven by the cardiac actin promoter and
any promoter can be cloned in front of the ECFP codingsequences. Finally, the HindIII–SmaI fragment containingﬁve copies of the GAL4 consensus binding sites (UAS)
linked to the hsp70 TATA box was isolated from plasmid
GUAS-GFP3 (gift from E. Amaya) (Bronchain et al., 1999)derived from pUAST (Brand and Perrimon, 1993) andsubcloned into plasmid pBicolor, creating UAS –ECFP
(UAS –ECFP/pCAR –RFP). Transgenic lines used in this
study were generated as previously described (Of ﬁeld et
al., 2000) with some modi ﬁcations (see Transgenesis in
X.tropicalis atX.tropicalis website: http://minerva.acc.
Virginia.EDU/ ,develbio/trop/).
4.2. GAL4 mRNA injections
A male transgenic UAS –ECFP founder was outcrossed to
a wild-type counterpart. One blastomere of two-cell stageembryos of this cross was injected with 1 or 10 pg of capped
synthetic GAL4 RNA transcribed in vitro using SP6 poly-
merase from a NotI-linearized pCS2/GAL4 template (gift of
E. Amaya) encoding native GAL4 DNA binding and activa-tion domains. Resulting embryos were then analyzed forGAL4-induced ECFP expression and the expression ofRFP in the muscle.
4.3. RU486 treatments and Western analysis
For experiments involving treatment with RU486
(Biomol Research Labs Inc.), embryos expressing activator
and effector transgenes were produced by crossing a lowbackground F1 transgenic effector animal (see Section 2)to a GALPR activator founder. Embryos were cultured in 0(solvent control), 5, or 25 nM RU486 freshly diluted in 0 :1£
MBS with 0.1% BSA from a stock initially dissolved inDMSO at 25 mg/ml and subsequently diluted to 5.8 mM
in 1 M acetic acid. Eye extracts were prepared by sonicating
head tissue consisting primarily of eye rudiment dissected
from RU486-treated embryos in a standard NP-40 lysisbuffer. Protein levels were quanti ﬁed by Bradford assay
(Bio-Rad) and 5 mg of extracted protein was separated on
a 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate –polyacrylamide electrophor-
esis gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane(Osmonics Inc.). The blot was probed with the LivingColors A.v. Peptide antibody (Clontech) recognizing
EGFP derivatives and an Anti-Actin antibody (Sigma)
diluted 1:100 or 1:1000, respectively. The signals werevisualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia). Finally, inten-sities of resulting bands were determined and calculatedusing the Kodak Digital Science Image Station 440 CF(NEN).
4.4. Photomicroscopy
Images of transgenic embryos were obtained using a
Zeiss Stemi Epi- ﬂuorescence stereoscope with GFP 500
and rhodamine ﬁlter sets. Images were captured using a
Dage MTI 330 cooled CCD camera.J. Chae et al. / Mechanisms of Development 117 (2002) 235–241 240
