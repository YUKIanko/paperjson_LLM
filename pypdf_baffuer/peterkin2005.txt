Abstract
The transcription factors GATA-4,-5and-6are expressed very early in heart tissue. Essential GATA sites have been detected in several
cardiac genes and the cardiac GATA factors interact with a wide variety of cofactors which synergistically increase gene expression. Thesemulti-protein transcriptional complexes confer promoter-speciﬁcity on the GATA factors and also on the more broadly expressed cofactors.Here we summarise the data on these interactions and represent the conclusions as a GATA factor-based genetic regulatory network for theheart. Of the three cardiac GATAs, GATA-4 is by far the most extensively studied, however, loss-of-function data question its presumeddominance during heart development as opposed to hypertrophy.© 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

1. Introduction
The incidence of congenital heart disease is around one
percent of live births, with cardiac abnormalities being themost prevalent defects reported at birth [1]. This high rate
of cardiac defects is likely to stem from the complexity ofheartdevelopmentandtherefore,tounderstandthesecardiacpathologies, we need to deﬁne the molecular pathways in-volvedinnormalheartdevelopment.MembersoftheGATAfamily of transcription factors are amongst the ﬁrst to beexpressed in the developing heart. The family comprisessix members, which can be subdivided into two subfami-lies based on sequence similarity and expression proﬁles.GATA-1,-2and-3are involved in haematopoeisis and ec-
todermalpatterning,whilst GATA-4,-5and-6areexpressed
in cardiac tissue and endodermal derivatives [2,3]. They all
containtwozincﬁngersrequiredforbindingtothesequence(A/T)GATA(A/G) and for protein–protein interactions [3].

mice was mild in comparison with predictions from the P19
data.Ithasbeensuggestedthatthismaybeduetoincreasedlevels ofGATA-6expression seen in the GATA-4null mice,
implying a certain degree of redundancy within the GATAfamily[6,7,9]. This suggestion, however, was not supported
byantisenseexperimentsinchickembryos,wheredepletionof a single or two GATA (4, 5 or 6) transcripts resulted innormalheartformation,andevenpartialdeletionofallthreecausedafailureofventralmorphogenesis(cardiabiﬁda)withno obvious defects in cardiomyocyte maturation, reminis-centofthe GATA-4 −/−mice[10].Thus,itseemslikelythat
thedifferencesintheseverityofphenotypesseenreﬂectdif-ferences between embryos and cell lines. Consistent withthis suggestion, GATA-6was not induced in P19 cells when
GATA-4was ablated, unlike in GATA-4null mice [4].
The cardiac defects seen when GATA-4was inactivated
arelikelytobenon-cellautonomousas GATA-4 −/−EScells
contributed to an apparently normal heart in chimeric mice[6,9].GATA-4 −/−cells were detected in the myocardium
andendocardium,inatriaandventricles [6].Chimerastudies
also suggest that ventral morphogenesis defects are due tolack ofGATA-4in the endoderm rather than the mesoderm
[11].However,gain-of-functionexperimentsin Xenopusem-
bryoscausedprematureexpressionofcardiacdifferentiationmarkers,andinpresumptiveectoderminducedheartmarkerexpression and in some cases spontaneous cardiomyocytebeating[12,13].Whenendoderminductionwasblocked,car-
diac marker expression increased, suggesting a role for thisGATAfactorwithintheinducedmyocardialcellsthemselves.However, GATA-5was similarly active in this assay leaving
openthepossibilitythat GATA-4wasfulﬁllingamoregeneral
requirementforGATAactivityinthisassay.Thus,thepreciserole played by GATA-4in cardiac mesoderm is still unclear.
GATA-4is expressed throughout development and also
in the adult heart. Clinical studies have indicated a role inhuman congenital heart defects (CHD) [14,15]. FISH anal-
ysis of CHD patients with a deletion of the terminal end ofchromosome 8p, which contains many genes, revealed a de-ﬁciency in GATA-4[14]. More recent work has been able
to establish a role for GATA-4in patients without the com-
plications of such a dramatic deletion. A heterozygous mis-sense mutation adjacent to the C terminal zinc ﬁnger, whichis required for DNA binding and interaction with cofactors,was found in family members with CHD, speciﬁcally atrialseptal defects (ASD), although additional septal and valvedefects were also seen [15]. The resultant protein had di-
minished DNA binding, which was the likely cause of thereducedtransactivationalcapacityobservedwhencomparedwithwildtypeGATA-4.Asecondfamilywasalsoidentiﬁedwith ASD which segregated with GATA-4mutations. This
turned out to be a frame shift mutation, predicted to causea premature stop codon resulting in a truncated protein ordecayofthetranscript.Thediscoveryoftwounrelatedfami-liesinwhichtransmissionofASDisassociatedwith GATA-4
mutations,stronglyimplicatesthisGATAfamilymemberinCHD.Heartdiseasecanoftenbeattributedtothedeathofcardiac
muscle cells. Strong evidence supports a role for GATA-4
(andGATA-6) in apoptosis and adult cardiomyocyte sur-
vival during hypertrophy [16], which may provide insights
into their roles during embryogenesis. Survival genes suchasHGFandEndothelin-1 activated MEK/ERK-dependent
signalling pathways which increased the DNA binding ac-tivity of GATA-4 via phosphorylation of serine 105 [16].A
subsequent increase in anti-apoptotic gene expression wasseen thereby regulating cell survival. In contrast, when car-diomyocyte apoptosis was stimulated, a decrease in GATA-
4expression was seen [17]. It has been demonstrated that
apoptosis can be rescued by the restoration of GATA-4(or
GATA-6), clearly showing that GATA-4can regulate cell
survival in the adult heart. During hypertrophy, inhibitionof GATA-4 activity can also be achieved by regulation ofits nuclear accumulation [18]. GSK3 /H9252decreased nuclear
GATA-4 by stimulating nuclear export, probably by directphosphorylation of GATA-4 and export via Crm1, a nu-clear exportin. Taken together, it is apparent that GATA-4
is important for later aspects of heart development, such asvalve and septum formation, which is affected in patientswith CHD, and is also likely to be important in hypertro-phy.
2.2. GATA-5
Null mutations in GATA-5caused no obvious cardiac de-
fectsinthemouse,whereasinzebraﬁshasimilarphenotypetoGATA-4nullmicewasseen(cardiabiﬁda),raisingthepos-
sibility that functions may have been differentially assignedtothesetwoGATAfactorsduringevolution [3,19].However,
thesemicemayexpressatruncatedformofGATA-5,contain-ing both zinc ﬁngers and the C-terminal activation domain,which would still be transcriptionally active, thus a role forGATA-5duringmurinecardiogenesiscannotyetbeexcluded
[20]. In fact, chicken GATA-5is differentially regulated by
twoalternativenon-codingexons [21].Thisisacommonfea-
ture in members of the GATA family, mouse GATA-1[22],
humanandmouse GATA-2[23,24],humanandmouse GATA-
3[25]andhumanandmouse GATA-6[26]genesallpossess
two distinct promoter-ﬁrst exon combinations. In the caseofGATA-5,twodistinctisoformswereproduced [21].Inter-
estingly,oneisoformencodedatruncatedproteinwhichonlycontainsonezincﬁnger.Thisisoformexcludedexon2whichcontains the translation start site (which was targeted in theGATA-5null mouse), yet a functionally active protein was
still produced.
In contrast to the GATA-4null mice, which express wild
type levels of many of the terminal differentiation markers[6,7],faust(GATA-5) mutant zebraﬁsh exhibit a reduction
in the expression of many of these markers [19]. In addi-
tion, the expression of the early regulator Nkx2.5was also
downregulated,thusbothearlyandlatercardiaceventswereaffectedinthesemutants.Overexpressionof GATA-5inze-

ofNkx2.5,GATA-4,-6and later myocardial genes in car-
diac tissue but also induced ectopic expression of some ofthese genes in non-cardiac tissue [19]. Occasionally such
regions could spontaneously contract. More recently, a re-quirement for GATA-5has been demonstrated for the en-
docardial differentiation of a mouse cell line derived fromcardiac mesoderm [27]. Inhibition of GATA-5 in these cell
lines, induced towards an endocardial fate by retinoic acid,blocked terminal differentiation at a pre-endocardial stage.This observation is consistent with the expression patternofGATA-5which becomes restricted to the endocardium
during development [28]. Furthermore, faustembryos lack
endocardial cells [19]. These data suggest that the role
of GATA-5 during cardiogenesis may be conserved acrossspecies.
2.3. GATA-6
Little information on the role of GATA-6during cardio-
genesishasemergedfrom GATA-6nullmice,whichdieprior
toheartinduction,atE5.5–7.5,duetodefectsinextraembry-onicendoderm [29,30].Thus,ofthemammalianGATAfac-
torsitappearsthat GATA-6isrequiredattheearlieststageof
development. GATA-6 −/−ES cells were able to contribute
to the heart in chimeric embryos and to differentiate intomyocardiuminvitro,indicatingthatthelossofGATA-6pro-tein does not cause cell autonomous cardiac defects. Gain-of-functionexperimentsin Xenopusembryos,however,sug-
gested that GATA-6does play a role in cardiogenesis [31].
GATA-6expression in heart precursors decreases as cardiac
machinery gene expression commences. Elevating GATA-6
beyondthistimedelayedtheonsetofterminaldifferentiation.Once degradation of the exogenous mRNA had occurred,maturation proceeded, resulting in an increased thickness inthemyocardium.Therefore,thesedataindicatedthat GATA-6
may hold the cardiac precursors in a progenitor and prolif-erative state, needing to be downregulated for heart cells tomature.Morerecentloss-of-functionexperimentsin Xenopus
and zebraﬁsh, using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides,haveshownfortheﬁrsttimethatGATA-6isrequiredfordif-ferentiationofthecardiaclineageduringembryogenesis [32].
Therequirementappearstobeinthematurationofthecardiacprogenitors rather than in their initial induction. It has alsobeen demonstrated with large dorsal marginal zone explantconjugates from Xenopusembryos that GATA-6 is required
within the cardiac mesoderm itself but also in the adjacentdeep anterior endoderm. Finally, the similarity between thephenotypes of BMP inhibition and GATA-6 depletion sug-gested a role for GATA-6in this signalling pathway, and it
was shown to regulate BMP-4expression, presumably via
thefunctionalGATAsitesinthepromoter [32,33].Thisfunc-
tionforGATA-6inthedevelopingmyocardiumexplainsthelack of phenotype in chimeras and embryoid bodies, whereBMP-4wouldbeavailablefromsurroundingwildtypecellsor serum.3. Combinatorial interactions
Forced expression of GATA-4in P19 cells showed that
itwasnotsufﬁcienttoinitiatecardiomyocytedifferentiationunless the cells were aggregated, suggesting that additionalfactors are required for GATA-4 dependent transcriptionalactivity[4]. There are several other families of transcription
factorsthatplayrolesincardiogenesis [34].Thetemporaland
tissuespeciﬁcexpressionofcardiacgenesduringcardiogen-esis is likely to be controlled by combinatorial interactionsbetweenmembersofthesetranscriptionfactorfamilies.Fur-thermore,thespeciﬁcrolesforGATA-4,-5and-6incardio-genesisarelikelytobedeterminedbytheseinteractions.Theinteractionofubiquitouslyexpressedfactorssuchasp300andYY1withthetissuerestrictedGATAfactorssuggeststhatincardiomyocytes GATA factors are acting as tissue speciﬁcaccessory factors for the participation of these ubiquitousfactors in cardiogenesis [35–37].
In order to integrate the rapidly expanding number of in-
teractions, we have begun to build genetic regulatory net-works (Fig. 1)[38]. Regulatory connections between two
genes must satisfy three criteria: (1) the expression of theputative target is affected by perturbation of its activator orrepressor;(2)theexpressionpatternsofthetargetanditsup-stream activator/repressor must be consistent with their pro-posed relationship; (3) the promoter/enhancers of the targetgenemustcontainbindingsitesfortheactivating/repressingtranscription factor or the target must be shown to responddirectlytotheupstreamfactor.Aconnectionthatsatisﬁesallthreecriteriaisillustratedusingasolidline.Connectionsthatsatisfy two criteria are shown with a dotted line. In severalcases, multiple factors have been shown to complex at onebinding site. Here, the line representing this connection issolid, but composed of colours representing each factor thatinteracts at that DNA binding site. The network is accessi-bleontheworldwidewebininteractiveform [90],wherethe
inputs or outputs from individual genes can be highlighted(seeforexample Fig.2).Clickingonindividualconnections
takes you to the evidence for that connection.
To date many of the combinatorial interactions between
the GATA factors and other cardiac transcription factorshave been deﬁned for GATA-4 alone. In addition to interac-tionswithotherfamilies,studiesinpostnatalcardiomyocytesdemonstrated that GATA-4 and -6 can functionally interactwith each other, at a single GATA element, to synergisti-cally activate the ANFandBNPpromoters ( Fig. 3A)[39].
Functional interaction and co-operativity required both zincﬁngersandtheC-terminalactivationdomainofGATA-4,butnot its DNA binding activity.
3.1. Nkx2.5
Several studies have shown that GATA-4 and Nkx2.5 di-
rectly interact at the protein level to regulate the expressionof theANF,α-cardiac actin andcardiac restricted ankyrin
repeatprotein (CARP)promoters [40].AttheANFpromoter,

The output of each gene is shown as activating or repressing target genes. At each target gene any regulatory interactions that have been described are represented as logical interactions (‘and’, ‘or’ or ‘syn’).
The various elements of the network can be identiﬁed using the key. Panel B illustrates the complex interactions of FOG-2 and p300 with GATA-4. p300 inc reases GATA-4 activity in the absence of FOG-2.
FOG-2 and GATA-4 form a complex in the absence of p300 and can either repress or activate target genes. When both FOG-2 and p300 are present, FOG-2 binds p 300, so reducing the activity of GATA-4 by
competition.

GATA-4andNkx2.5wereshowntobemutualco-factorsinits
synergisticactivation( Fig.3B)[41].Structuralandfunctional
studies indicated that the carboxy-terminal zinc-ﬁnger anda C-terminal extension of GATA-4 binds to the C-terminalauto-repressivedomainofNkx2.5,causingaconformationalchangeexposingtheNkx2.5activationdomains.GATA-5cansubstitute for GATA-4 in this interaction but GATA-6 can-not, suggesting that the interaction with Nkx2.5 can conveyfunctional speciﬁcity to GATA factors during development(Fig. 3C)[41]. Binding of both the Nkx and GATA proteins
to their respective DNA elements within the ANFpromoter
was required for maximal synergy, but synergy was also de-tected when the GATA binding sites were absent [42,43].
Fig.2. GeneticregulatorynetworkhighlightingtheoutputsfromGATA-4andNkx2.5.DownstreaminteractionsinvolvingGATA-4andNkx2.5arehighli ghted
to facilitate clarity. This is achievable for all genes in the network, both upstream and downstream, at web reference [90].This suggested that Nkx2.5 can recruit GATA-4 or -5 into
a transcriptionally active complex at the ANFpromoter. De-
spite the expression of additional Nkx2 family members inthecardiacmesoderm,combinatorialinteractionswithothercardiac transcription factors have been deﬁned for Nkx2.5alone[44]. The synergistic GATA/Nkx2 interaction appears
tobeevolutionarilyconservedbetweentheﬂy,nematodeandmammals [2].
TheXenopus ANF gene promoter has a high degree of
conservationwithitsmammaliancounterparts [45].Thisin-
dicatesthatthetranscriptionalmechanismsthatregulate ANF
expression are conserved among evolutionarily diverse or-ganisms. Mutation of individual binding sites in embryos

proteins shown in the complex, with the exception of NFAT3 and YY1 which interact on the BNP promoter (a related family member), have been identiﬁedto synergistically co-operate with GATA factors on ANF. The spatial binding of transcription factors on the DNA does not necessarily represent an in vivo
situation but highlights the complexity of this promoter. GTM=general transcriptional machinery.

expressing an ANFtransgene indicated that the T-box ele-
ment (TBE), the distal GATA site and the serum responseelements (SREs) are essential for ANFtranscription. This is
in agreement with the combinatorial interactions describedand highlights the importance of the distal GATA site inthese interactions ( Fig. 3D). The proximal GATA site and
the Nkx element (NKE), however, had little effect on trans-geneexpressioninthemyocardiumbutwereimportantintherestrictionofexpressiontotheatrium.ThisindicatesthattheDNA binding activity of Nkx2.5 is dispensable in the acti-vation of ANFexpression and that binding sites for GATA,
serum response factor (SRF) and Tbx5 are sufﬁcient for re-cruitmentto,andsynergisticactivationof,thepromoter [46].
Thus, the proximal GATA and NKE binding sites may beimportant for the assembly of a repressor complex requiredfor atrial speciﬁc expression of the ANFgene. In support of
this, mutation of the NKE site caused an up-regulation ofANFpromoter activity in ventricular tissue, consistent with
aninhibitoryroleforthissite [41].Thus,GATAsiteswithin
a promoter may have distinct functions.
Nkx2.5andGATA-4have been identiﬁed as downstream
targetsofBMPsignalling [47–50].Studiesin Xenopusindi-
cated that BMP signalling was required for cardiomyocytematuration but not initial induction [51,52]. Identiﬁcation
of GATA sites in the BMPpromoter suggest that a positive
feedback loop may exist between GATA and BMP-4, and invivo a role for GATA-6 in the maintenance of BMP-4and
Nkx2.5expression has been deﬁned [32,33]. A recent study
demonstrated that GATA-4 can physically interact, throughits C-terminal zinc ﬁnger and adjacent basic domain, withthe N-terminal domain of SMAD-1 and -4, the intracellularmediators of BMP signalling, to synergistically activate theNkx2.5promoterinP19cells( Fig.3E)[53].GATA-5and-6
can also physically interact with SMAD, and GATA-6 hasbeenshowntofunctionallysubstituteforGATA-4inthisco-operation.Therefore,GATAfactorsareabletoregulateBMPsignalling by two mechanisms: by affecting the expressionlevelsofBMPandbyinteractingwithdownstreameffectorsof BMP signalling.
3.2. MADS proteins
Targeted disruption of the SRFgene in mice indicated
that this member of the MADS domain family of proteinsis critical for cardiac mesoderm development [54]. SRF can
physicallyinteractwithGATA-4orNkx2.5tosynergisticallyactivate the ANFandα-actingenes in cardiomyocytes [40].
GATA-5 and -6 can also synergise with SRF on the ANF
and α-actinpromoters. More recent studies demonstrated
that GATA-4 can form part of a triad complex with Nkx2.5and SRF to more efﬁciently activate cardiac genes [46,55].
SRF was shown to be responsible for recruiting Nkx2.5 andGATA-4 to the α-cardiac actin promoter in promyocardial
andembryonicstemcells,andformationofthecomplexap-peared to enhance the SRF DNA binding afﬁnity [46](as
illustrated in Fig. 3D). Whether it was SRF or Nkx2.5 thatwasresponsibleforrecruitingGATA-4tothecomplexhasnot
been determined but it is thought that the unmasking of theNkx2.5C-terminalrepressivedomainbyGATA-4,incombi-nationwiththeincreasedDNAbindingafﬁnityofSRFbythecomplex,wasresponsiblefortherobustsynergisticactivationseen with all three factors.
AnothersubfamilyoftheMADS-boxfamilyoftranscrip-
tional regulators, myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2) pro-teins,havebeenimplicatedincardiomyocytematurationanddifferentiation [56,57].GATA-4recruitedMEF2tothe ANF
promoter, which does not contain MEF-2 binding sites, andthe physical interaction between these two proteins resultedin its synergistic activation ( Fig. 3F)[58]. GATA-6, but not
GATA-5,cansubstituteforGATA-4inthissynergisticinter-action demonstrating further functional differences betweenGATA-4, -5 and -6. α-Cardiac actin ,α-myosin heavy chain
andBNPwere also identiﬁed as targets for GATA-4 and
MEF2C co-operation.
3.3. Tbx family
Co-expression of Tbx5 and GATA-4 in HeLa cells and
primary cardiomyocytes resulted in co-operative activationof theANFpromoter [15]similar to that observed for Tbx5
and Nkx2.5 [59]. The similar effect of the Tbx5 missense
mutations,isolatedfromfamilieswithHolt-Oramsyndrome,on interaction with GATA-4 and Nkx2.5, as demonstratedbyco-immunoprecipitationassays,suggestedthatacomplexconsistingofTbx5,Nkx2.5andGATA-4mayfunctionintheregulationofasubsetofcardiacgenes [15].Anothercardiac
expressedT-boxfactor,Tbx20,hasbeenshowntophysicallyinteract with Nkx2.5, GATA-4 and -5, -6 was not analysed[60]. Nkx2.5, GATA-4 or -5 and Tbx20 can interact in com-
binations on the promoter region of the ANFgene or the
endocardial Gja5(connexin40) gene to synergistically acti-
vate cardiac gene expression in ﬁbroblasts, with the great-est effects occurring with a combination of the three, fur-ther supporting the proposition that an Nkx2.5, Tbx, GATAcomplexoperatesintheregulationofspeciﬁccardiacgenes.Tbx20 was also shown to preferentially collaborate withGATA-5,overGATA-4and-6,andNkx2.5tosynergisticallyactivate the Gja5promoter, demonstrating functional differ-
ences between the subfamily members in regulating cardiacgenetranscription.Inthemouse,GATA-5isthepredominantfactor expressed with Tbx20 in the endocardium and it hasbeen shown to regulate endocardial differentiation in vitro[27]. Hence, the regulatory relationship between Tbx20 and
GATA-5maybeimportantinendocardialdevelopment [60].
3.4. NF-AT transcription factors
Themultigenefamilyoftranscriptionfactors,NF-AT(nu-
clear factor of activated T-cells), alter gene expression in re-sponsetocalciumsignaling.Aco-operativeroleforGATA-5and NF-ATc in endocardial transcription has been identiﬁedininvitrostudiesusingtheGATA-dependentpromoterofthe

endothelialgene ET-1,whichwaspreferentiallyactivatedby
GATA-5[27]. Physical interaction of GATA-5 and NF-ATc
wasnotdemonstratedinthisstudyandfunctionalinteractionof NF-ATc with GATA-4 or -6 was not discounted. A sec-ondmemberofthisgenefamily,NF-AT3,hasbeenshowntointeract via its C-terminal DNA binding Rel homology do-main with the C terminal zinc ﬁnger of GATA-4, as well asGATA-5 and -6 ( Fig. 3G)[61]. The interaction with GATA-
4 led to a synergistic activation of cardiac gene expression,duringhypertrophy.Takentogether,itislikelythatco-factorshelp to restrict GATA factor activity to myocardium and en-docardium.
3.5. p300
A ubiquitously expressed general regulator of transcrip-
tion, p300, can directly interact with GATA-4 to synergis-tically activate the ANF,α-MHCandβ-MHCpromoters in
ﬁbroblasts [62].p300isamemberofthesamefamilyofpro-
teinsascAMP-responsebindingprotein(CBP).Itpossesseshistoneacetyltransferaseactivityandactsasatranscriptionalco-activatorformanyDNAbindingfactors [63].Morerecent
invitrostudiesinHeLacellsandprimarycardiomyocytesin-dicate that GATA-4 and dHAND physically interact to forma complex, and the interaction of dHAND with p300 is nec-essary for the functional synergy of GATA-4 and dHANDon cardiac promoters ( Fig. 3H)[37]. Functional synergism
wasshowntorequiretheGATAsitewithinthepromoterandnot the dHAND site [37]. In contrast to Nkx2.5, NF-AT3,
MEF-2 and SRF, that interact with the C-terminal zinc ﬁn-ger, and FOG-2, that interacts with the N-terminal zinc ﬁn-ger of GATA-4, p300 can bind to either ﬁnger. Thus, p300mayactasascaffoldproteinintheassemblyofmultisubunittranscription factor complexes for speciﬁc cardiac promot-ers,therebyconferringfurtherspeciﬁcity [37].p300canalso
physically interact with GATA-5 in vivo, and co-operate toactivate the ANFpromoter [35].
MEF-2 has also been shown to physically interact with
p300[64–66]. Gel mobility shift analysis of MEF-2 bind-
ing activity in a programmed reticulocyte lysate identiﬁedp300 as part of the shifted complex, indicating the presenceofendogenousp300 [66].Interestingly,thecharacterisedin-
teractions of GATA-4 with Nkx2.5, SRF, MEF-2 or NF-ATutilisedprogrammedreticulolysates,hencethesefactorsmayhavebeeninteractingthroughp300 [37].Thus,p300mayplay
a central role in the functional and physical interactions ofcardiactranscriptionfactorswiththeGATAfactorsfacilitat-ing the formation of multisubunit complexes.
3.6. YY1
Anotherubiquitouslyexpressedgeneralregulatoroftran-
scription is the zinc-ﬁnger protein YY1 which is capable ofactivatingandrepressingtranscription [67].Itcanalsocause
bendingofDNAandchromatinremodelling.Intransactivat-ing theBNPpromoter in Hela and CV1 cells, it can syner-gistically co-operate with GATA-4 via GATA and not YY1
bindingsites [36].However,interactionofYY1withGATA-
4 was dependent upon the DNA binding domain of YY1and appeared to be mediated via the CBP/p300 class of pro-teins (Fig. 3I). InXenopus transgenics, the pan-myocardial
expression of the cardiac speciﬁc marker myosin light chain
2(MLC2) was dependent upon the combined activities of
GATA factors, SRF and YY1 [68]. GATA-4 and SRF can
simultaneously bind to the MLC2promoter in vitro. In pre-
sumptiveectoderm,simultaneousoverexpressionofGATA-4andSRFresultedinthesynergisticactivationofthepromoter.In the promoter region a YY1 binding site overlaps with theSRE and inactivation of this site led to a broadening andweakeningofXMLC2promoteractivity.TheabilityofYY1to act as both a repressor and an activator led the authors tosuggest that the repressor activity of YY1 may be responsi-bleforrestrictingexpressiontothecardiacmuscle,whileitsactivatingabilitypositivelyregulatedpromoteractivity.YY1mayalsobeinvolvedinpromotingloadingofSRFtothelowafﬁnitySRE.Togethertheseresultssuggestthatafunctionalinteraction between a GATA factor and SRF is importantinXMLC2regulation and both the SRE and YY1 sites are
required for heart speciﬁc expression. Thus, combinatorialinteractionsinvolvingGATAproteinsappeartobeimportantinharnessingtheactivityofubiquitousfactors,suchasp300and YY1, for cardiac gene expression.
3.7. FOG
The founding member of the Friend of GATA-1 (FOG)
family of cofactors, FOG-1, is expressed predominantly in
developing haematopoietic cells and interacts with GATA-1in the mediation of erythroid and megakaryocytic matura-tion[69]. A recent study involving transgenic rescue of the
haematopoieticdefectof FOG-1 −/−miceuncoveredanun-
suspected role for FOG-1in the development of the outﬂow

The expression patterns of GATA-4,-5and -6, and a sec-
ond FOG factor, FOG-2, overlap in the developing heart.
FOG-2 can interact with the N-terminal zinc ﬁngers of allGATAfactors [71–73].Duringcardiogenesis,FOG-2appears
to repress the transcriptional activity of GATA-4 ( Fig. 1B)
[72,74].FunctionalanalysisoftheFOG-2proteinresultedin

thus when bound to FOG-2, p300 can no longer co-activate
GATA-4 resulting in the repression of GATA-4 dependenttranscriptional activity ( Fig. 3L). Therefore it would seem

Retinoids are compounds derived from dietary Vitamin
A and have been shown to regulate late cardiac growth anddevelopment,andhypertrophy.Retinoidsbindtoligandacti-vated nuclear receptor transcription factors termed retinoidreceptors. Retinoid X receptors (RXRs) are generally be-lieved to be the master regulators of the retinoid signallingpathway. The failure of the ventricular myocardium to de-velopnormallyin RXR α-nullmiceisevidenceofthis [76,77].
A novel mechanism by which retinoids can regulate cardiacgeneexpressionthroughdirectinteractionwithGATA-4andFOG-2 has been proposed recently ( Fig. 3M)[78]. The in-
teractionofFOG-2withRXRinaligand-dependentmannerwas believed to be responsible for recruiting FOG-2 to theGATA-4interfaceforthesubsequentrepressionof ANFpro-
moteractivity.TheDNAbindingdomainofRXRwasshownto interact with the C-terminal zinc ﬁnger region and site(s)within the C-terminal domain of the GATA-4 protein. TheN-terminalzincﬁngerdomainwasnecessaryforinteractionwith FOG-2, hence it is possible that GATA-4 binds to bothproteins simultaneously.
In summary, combinatorial interactions with other tran-
scription factors involved in cardiogenesis are likely to be-stow temporal, tissue and gene speciﬁcity on the cardiacGATA factors. Data for GATA-5 and -6 equivalent to thosefor GATA-4, however, are currently lacking.
4. Regulation of GATA-4, -5and -6 expression
It is becoming apparent that cardiac genes are regulated
in a modular fashion by multiple enhancers. For example,Nkx2.5is controlled by multiple cardiac-speciﬁc enhancers
that contain essential GATA sites [79,80]. Similarly, the
dHANDcardiac enhancer can be subdivided into two dis-
tinctsubregionsthatdriveexpressionintherightventricleoroutﬂowtract [81].Thisrecurringthemeextendstomembers
of the GATA family expressed in the heart. In chicken, twocontrolregionswereshowntoregulateexpressionof GATA-5
[21].Thedistalregionwasactivatedintheembryonicendo-
derm, whilst the other control region functioned in the heartand late gut. Two distinct heart speciﬁc enhancers were alsolocated upstream of chicken GATA-6[82,83]. Characterisa-
tion of these regulatory regions in transgenic mouse assaysdemonstratedthatthedistalenhanceractivatedexpressioninthe cardiac crescent and linear heart tube [83]. Expression
was subsequently downregulated in the atria and ventricles,whilstexpressionintheoutﬂowtractpersisted.Thisenhancercontained Nkx2.5 binding sites which were required for itsactivity.Themoreproximalenhancerdirectedexpressioninthe atrioventricular (AV) canal at very early stages and per-sisted in mature cells in the AV conductive system [82,83].Similar studies of mouse GATA-6also identiﬁed an Nkx-
dependent enhancer [84]. However, the endogenous expres-
sion ofGATA-6was not completely recapitulated in these
experiments making it likely that other regulatory elementsarestilltobefound.Recentlyazebraﬁsh GATA-4cardiacen-
hancer was discovered [85]. The more proximal regulatory
region directed expression to the bulboventricular valve androstral (ventricular) part of the heart tube, whilst the distalelements were required for AV valve and caudal (atrial) ex-pression of GATA-4. T-box binding sites located within the
distalregionoftheenhancerhavebeenshowntobeessentialfor expression, suggesting that GATA-4may be a direct tar-
getforT-boxtranscriptionfactors,suchasTbx5,intheheart.Consistent with this, Tbx5 null mice fail to express GATA-4
in the myocardium [86].
5. Summary
Fewwouldarguethat GATA-4,-5and-6areunimportantin
development of the myocardium. Nevertheless, much of thedatasupportingtheirimportancederivesfromexperimentsincell culture. The data from developing embryos is currentlyinconclusive.Forexampleloss-of-functiondatainmouseandchick embryos suggest either no role in speciﬁcation anddifferentiationofthemyocardium,oratmostaredundantone.In contrast, experiments in Xenopus and zebraﬁsh embryos
reveal critical functions for both GATA-5 and -6. It will beimportant to determine if this extends to the mouse in viewof the potentially active protein remaining in the GATA-5
null. A strong role for GATA-5 in endocardium formationis starting to emerge, where it is required in both mammalsand zebraﬁsh. GATA-6is required for maintenance of the
myocardium,butnotitsinitialspeciﬁcation,inboth Xenopus
and zebraﬁsh. An important link between BMP signallingand GATA-6 explains the ability of GATA-6null ES cells to
contributetohearttissueinchimericembryosandembryoidbodies.
ForGATA-4,theevidenceisstrongthatitplaysaroledur-
ing late heart development such as heart septation and valveformation.ThecardiacmalformationsseeninhumanswhenGATA-4isdisruptedaresimilartothoseseenwithHolt-Oram
syndrome mutations in Tbx5, and when Nkx2.5is mutated
[87–89]. However, its role during early development of the
heartisunclear.Theearliestappearstobeinendodermwhereit is required for ventral closure and morphogenesis of thecardiac primordia. Furthermore, GATA-4is unable to com-
pensateforthelossofGATA-6inthedrivetowardsterminaldifferentiation [32]. Collectively, it appears that GATA-4is
not required for cardiac myocyte differentiation in the em-bryo.
Transcription of the GATA genes appears to be regulated
in a modular fashion, whilst complex formation is a majordeterminantoftransactivationalactivity.Theyareabletoin-teract with a wide variety of partners in many different tis-sues: both with ubiquitously expressed and tissue-restricted

moter with members of the GATA family. Further control isconferredbytheinteractionofGATAfactorswithrepressorssuch as FOG-2.
In conclusion, the roles of GATA-4,-5and-6in con-
trol of heart gene expression have been extensively studied.However,studiestodatemainlyconcentrateon GATA-4,es-
pecially with respect to interactions, and relationships withGATA-5and-6, which may be more relevant to early heart
development, will be important to deﬁne in the future.
