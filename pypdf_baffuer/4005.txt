Introduction
Gata transcription factors encode zinc-ﬁnger DNA-binding
proteins that regulate diverse pathways associated withembryonic morphogenesis and cellular differentiation (Patient
and McGhee, 2002). Gata4 was described initially as an early
cardiogenic marker, although the ﬁrst requirement ofmammalian Gata4 is within extra-embryonic visceral endodermfor embryonic morphogenesis (Kuo et al., 1997; Molkentin etal., 1997; Narita et al., 1997b). The gene is not required in
cardiomyocytes (Narita et al., 1997a) yet studies have implicatedGata4 in regulating various steps of heart formation, includingmorphogenesis, proliferation, cell survival, differentiation andgrowth (Pu et al., 2004; Watt et al., 2004; Zeisberg et al., 2005).A genetic mosaic analysis showed the gene is also required ingastric epithelium (Jacobsen et al., 2002), and a few target genesfor Gata4 are described for differentiated cells of the intestine
(Gao et al., 1998; Her et al., 2004), liver (Cirillo et al., 2002;
Dame et al., 2004) and pancreas (Ritz-Laser et al., 2005). Furtherprogress in evaluating the function of mammalian Gata4 hasbeen limited, in large part, because of the early embryoniclethality of the knockout mouse embryos (E7.0-9.5).
However, recent progress has been made by taking
advantage of tetraploid embryo complementation assays,whereby wild-type cells rescue the requirement for Gata4 inextra-embryonic endoderm, with mutant cells constituting theembryo proper (Watt et al., 2004). These experiments revealedessential functions for Gata4 in heart tube morphogenesis(probably related speciﬁcally to pro-epicardial development).Gata6 is a closely related gene that is also required for extra-embryonic endoderm development (Koutsourakis et al., 1999;
Morrisey et al., 1998), and similar rescue experiments revealeda required role for Gata6 in liver development subsequent tohepatic speciﬁcation (Zhao et al., 2005). Because Gata4 andGata6 are expressed in overlapping patterns in both heart and
gut tissues, it raises the question of whether they might playredundant roles in some aspects of heart or liver development.The murine Gata4 ‘embryo-speciﬁc’ mutant embryos still dietoo early to evaluate a role in gut-derived organ development.In the case of Gata6 mutants, the heart appears to beunaffected. It was suggested that Gata4 might play a redundantrole for hepatic speciﬁcation, but unlike Gata6 might not berequired for subsequent organ growth (Zhao et al., 2005).
Here, we describe a loss-of-function analysis for Gata4 in
the zebraﬁsh. A primary advantage of this model is that, unlike
mouse, ﬁsh embryos are not dependent upon support from aprimitive (visceral) extra-embryonic tissue. Furthermore, themutant zebraﬁsh survive beyond the cardiomyopathy, asembryos do not require a functional heart for several days,including during the time for normal gut development. Usingthe morpholino approach, it is possible to block the expressionof both Gata4 and Gata6 in order to reveal potential functionalredundancies. We show that, in zebraﬁsh, Gata4 is essentialfor the generation of endoderm-derived organs, including theintestine, liver, pancreas and swim bladder. In addition, ourresults show that there is a functional redundancy betweenGata4 and Gata6 at an early stage of liver development.
Materials and methods
Zebraﬁsh strains
Zebraﬁsh embryos were maintained at 28°C and staged as described
(Westerﬁeld, 1995). The gata4:GFP reporter strain (line 39) has been
described previously (Heicklen-Klein and Evans, 2004). The ﬂi1:GFP
line (Lawson and Weinstein, 2002) was obtained from the Zebraﬁsh
International Research Center (Eugene, OR). The tie2:GFP line was
provided by Didier Stainier (UCSF, CA). The gata6:GFP line was
generated by inserting the GFP gene into an isolated PAC clone at theWe have developed a loss-of-function model for Gata4 in
zebraﬁsh, in order to examine broadly its requirement fororganogenesis. We show that the function of Gata4 inzebraﬁsh heart development is well conserved with that inmouse, and that, in addition, Gata4 is required for
development of the intestine, liver, pancreas and swimbladder. Therefore, a single transcription factor regulatesthe formation of many organs. Gata6 is a closely relatedtranscription factor with an overlapping expressionpattern. We show that zebraﬁsh depleted of Gata6 showdefects in liver bud growth similar to mouse Gata6 mutantsand zebraﬁsh Gata4 morphants, and that zebraﬁsh
embryos depleted of both Gata4 and Gata6 display anearlier block in liver development, and thus completely lackliver buds. Therefore, Gata4 and Gata6 have distinct non-redundant functions in cardiac morphogenesis, but are
redundant for an early step of liver development. Inaddition, both Gata4 and Gata6 are essential and non-redundant for liver growth following initial budding.

gata6 translational start site (representing the proximal ATG or ‘short
form’ of Gata6), using recombination in Escherichia coli (Jessen et
al., 1998). The recombinant PAC clone was injected into fertilized
eggs and potential founders screened by crosses, to establish a germ-line transmitting strain. The recombination step and establishment of
the gata6:GFP line was performed with the assistance of Dr Shuo Lin
and colleagues (UCLA, CA), and this line will be described in fulldetail in a subsequent report.
Morpholino design and microinjections
A Pac clone containing the gata4 gene was isolated and used to deﬁne
the 5/H11032UTR and intron/exon structure (Heicklen-Klein and Evans,
2004). Two morpholino oligomers were designed against the gata4
sequences (Gene Tools, LLC). MO (5-TCCAGGTGAGCGATTAT-
TGCTCC-3 /H11032) is complementary to the 5 /H11032UTR of the mature gata4
transcript (a translation blocker), whereas MO1 (5 /H11032-TGGACGCAGA-
CTGAGAGAAAGAGAG-3 /H11032) was designed to bind to sequences at
the boundary between intron 1 and exon 2 of the gata4 pre-mRNA (a
splicing blocker). Blast searches predicted that the morpholinosshould be speciﬁc for Gata4. Morpholinos were injected into fertilizedeggs in various doses to establish an optimal dose. Embryos presenteda consistent phenotype with injections of between 5 and 20 ng MO.All the experiments shown (except for Fig. 2C) used 10 ng MO perinjection. MO1 caused early embryonic death at high doses, butgenerated an identical phenotype to that generated by MO when usingless than 1 ng, and a typical dose used was 0.3 ng per injection. Themorpholino designed to target Gata6 was previously described andcharacterized with respect to speciﬁcity (Peterkin et al., 2003). Thismorpholino targets the ‘long form’ of Gata6, and the sequence is
present therefore in the RNA derived from the gata6:GFP transgene.
Whole-mount in situ hybridization
Whole-mount in situ hybridization was performed essentially as
described (Alexander et al., 1998). Brieﬂy, embryos were treated with0.003% phenylthiourea (PTU) to prevent pigmentation. After ﬁxation,embryos older than 24 hours were treated with 10 /H9262g/ml proteinase
K. Hybridization was performed at 70°C, in 50% formamide bufferwith digoxigenin-labeled RNA anti-sense probes. The probes used forin situ hybridization were prepared and used as described: Gata4/5/6(Heicklen-Klein and Evans, 2004), Nkx2.5 (Alexander et al., 1998),Cmlc2 and Amhc (Yelon et al., 1999). The probe for transferrin RNAwas derived from the RT-PCR product described below.
Histology
Embryos at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf) were ﬁxed in
paraformaldehyde, processed under standard conditions andembedded in paraffin wax. Cross sections at 5 /H9262m were cut with a
cryostat, mounted onto slides, and subjected to Hematoxylin and
Eosin staining. Sections were observed with brightﬁeld inverted light,and photographed at 20 /H11003magniﬁcation.
RT-PCR
RNA was isolated from staged embryos using Trizol Reagent, and
puriﬁed and used for reverse transcriptase (RT) reactions as describedpreviously (Jiang et al., 1998). Conditions for semi-quantitative RT-PCR were established empirically by testing cycle number andensuring that a 2-fold increase of input RNA led to an approximately2-fold increase in product. 20 /H9262l RT reactions contained either 1 or 2
/H9262g of RNA for one hour at 37°C. PCR reactions used 2 /H9262l of an RT
sample in 50 /H9262l. PCR primers are described in Table 1.
Results
Generation of a Gata4 loss-of-function model in
zebraﬁsh
It was of interest for us to examine the function of Gata4 in
zebraﬁsh development for several reasons. The comparativegenetics of Gata factors needs clariﬁcation, as ﬁsh embryos
with a mutation of Gata5 (the faust locus) have a cardia biﬁd
phenotype that resembles, at least superﬁcially, that of the
mouse Gata4 knockout (Reiter et al., 1999). This has led tospeculation that zebraﬁsh Gata5 is the functional ortholog ofmammalian Gata4. In addition, the mouse Gata4 knockout isearly embryonic lethal because of a requirement for the genein visceral endoderm, complicating the evaluation of otherphenotypes, if they exist. For these reasons, we usedmorpholino oligomers to target the speciﬁc knockdown ofGata4 in zebraﬁsh embryos. The ﬁrst morpholino (MO) was
designed to target a sequence just upstream of the putativeinitiation codon (ATG). To test the efficacy of the MO, it wasconvenient to exploit a line of transgenic animals expressingGFP under the control of gata4 genomic regulatory sequences,
including the 5 /H11032UTR encompassing the MO target sequence.
We chose a transgenic line we had generated that expressesGFP in the heart and also in the notochord (Heicklen-Klein andEvans, 2004). Although notochord does not express Gata4(presumably the transgene lacks a repressor element), thisallowed us to evaluate the effectiveness of the MO throughoutthe developing embryo and throughout early development.Thus, in this experiment GFP expression serves as a surrogatemarker for Gata4, and inhibition of GFP expression shouldreﬂect an effective block to translation of endogenous Gata4.
As shown in Fig. 1, transgenic gata4:GFP embryos that had
been injected at the one-cell stage with the Gata4-speciﬁc MOfail to express GFP in the heart or notochord. GFP expressionis fully blocked until at least 5 dpf. The analysis indicates thatthe ATG-targeted morpholino effectively interacts with thegata4 UTR sequence to inhibit translation. In addition, 100%
of the MO-injected embryos develop a consistent and penetrantphenotype by 2-3 dpf (Fig. 1B), although they continue tosurvive until approximately 6-8 dpf, thereby allowing us toinvestigate thoroughly the embryonic functions of Gata4.Injection of control morpholinos caused no abnormalphenotypes (data not shown).

4007 Gata4 regulates formation of many organs Development and disease
(Peterkin et al., 2003)], the Gata4 morphant embryos never
display a biﬁd phenotype. However, by 2-3 dpf, every injectedembryo is distinguished by a kink in the tail, regression of theyolk stalk extension, and a non-looping but beating heart tubewithin an edemic cavity (Fig. 2A,B). Development is slightly
delayed and the embryos are approximately 25% smaller thancontrols. To demonstrate that these phenotypes are speciﬁc tothe loss of Gata4, we designed a distinct morpholino (MO1),to target the splice site at the junction of the ﬁrst intron and thesecond exon, upstream of the region encoding the zinc ﬁngers.Injection of embryos with MO1 consistently generates aphenotype that is indistinguishable in all respects from thatcaused by the ATG-targeted MO (Fig. 2C, and data not shown).
Between 3 and 4 days of development, circulating blood is
no longer evident in the morphant embryos (Fig. 2D,E) andthey fail to inﬂate the swim bladder. The heart tube of MO-
injected embryos forms, beats, and appears to demarcatechambers, but looping and growth never occurs, leading tocardiac edema and, by 5 dpf, a severe heart-string phenotype(Fig. 2F). The embryos survive for several more days, and thisrevealed an additional striking phenotype. From 6-8 dpf, a longthin gut tube is evident through the body cavity that extendsthe length of the embryo (Fig. 2G). Histological analysis at 5dpf shows that in morphant embryos both the heart and guttubes form lumens, but subsequent organogenesis fails (Fig.

2H-M). The intestine lacks normal epithelial folds, a phenotype
that is more severe in caudal regions of the tube. Liver tissueis either not apparent, or is reduced to a small patch of cellswhen compared to the control. The exocrine pancreas is alsooften not apparent, although in some embryos there is evidence
of a small islet-like structure. The swim bladder is missing,whereas the large store of maternal yolk material, which hasbeen fully absorbed in control embryos, remains in the largeedemic body cavity of Gata4-depleted embryos. By contrast,many other tissues appear grossly normal, includingmesonephros, notochord, neural tube and body wall muscle.
Loss of Gata4 disrupts late cardiac morphogenetic
movements after initial heart tube formation
We ﬁrst characterized the cardiomyopathy caused by Gata4
deﬁciency. Given the hematopoietic defect, it seemed possiblethat the heart defect and edema could be a secondaryconsequence of poor ﬂuid exchange. We cultured injectedembryos in a solution of 250 mM mannitol, which preventssystemic edema by eliminating the osmotic water gradient (Hillet al., 2004). However, the morphant embryos cultured with orwithout mannitol developed an identical cardiac edema (notshown), indicating that the morphants have a speciﬁc defect inheart function. We evaluated whether the heart tube defectreﬂected abnormalities in overall vascular development bycomparing control and morphant embryos transgenic for theﬂi1:GFP reporter, which labels endothelium. Embryos injected
with the Gata4-speciﬁc MO develop a normal embryonic trunkvasculature when compared with control embryos at 3 dpf (seeFig. S1 in the supplementary material). Thus the defect isspeciﬁc to the heart tube.
Molecular markers were analyzed to evaluate the stage of
heart development affected by the loss of Gata4. Theexpression of Nkx2.5, an early marker for cardiogenicprogenitors, is normal at 19.5 hours post-fertilization (hpf),indicating that the initial stages of cardiogenesis are intact,including formation of the cardiac cone and the subsequentextension of the heart tube (Fig. 3A,B). Chamber speciﬁcationis also normal, as Amhc (an atrial marker) and Cmlc2 (an atrialand ventricular marker) are both expressed in the MO-injectedembryos (Fig. 3C-F). By evaluating GFP expression intie2:GFP transgenic ﬁsh injected with the Gata4 MO, we ﬁnd
that endocardium forms in the morphant embryos, includingthe establishment of cardiac cushions (see Fig. S2 in thesupplementary material). However, the marker analysis revealsthat between 2 and 3 dpf the shape of the heart tube becomesdisturbed relative to that in control embryos. This late defectwas also conﬁrmed by watching morphogenetic changes in theheart tube of transgenic embryos that express GFP incardiomyocytes (data not shown). Speciﬁcally, the more caudalpresumptive atrial portion of the tube fails to make theappropriate rostral-anterior jogging movement, or to expand insize relative to the presumptive ventricular region. Therefore,at this stage the heart tube remains straight and uniformly thin,and by 4 dpf forms a distended heart string.
Organogenesis from the primordial gut tube
requires Gata4
Similarly, we characterized the progression of endoderm
development in morphant embryos compared with controls.Early markers speciﬁc to endoderm, including Sox17 and
Foxa2, are expressed equivalently in control and morphant
embryos at 28 or 48 hpf (Fig. 4A), indicating that endodermspeciﬁcation is normal in embryos depleted for Gata4.However, at 4 dpf, expression of organ-speciﬁc markers fordifferentiated intestine (I-fabp), liver (transferrin) or pancreas
(elastaseB) are either absent or signiﬁcantly reduced in themorphant embryos (Fig. 4B). The reproducible low levels oftransferrin led us to consider whether some limited tissue hadin fact differentiated in the morphant embryos. Therefore,control and morphant embryos were analyzed for transferrinexpression by in situ hybridization at 2, 3, 4 and 5 dpf. Asshown in representative samples (Fig. 4D,F,H,J), weconsistently ﬁnd a small patch of transferrin-positive cells inmorphant embryos at the position of the liver bud by 2 dpf.However, this patch fails to expand at subsequent stages, whencompared with the control embryos. This result suggests that,
in embryos deﬁcient for Gata4, the liver bud is speciﬁed fromthe gut tube at the appropriate time and place, and that speciﬁedDevelopment 132 (17) Research article

hepatocytes can differentiate, but that the bud fails to grow and
expand in size, thus compromising organogenesis.
The stage that gut-derived organ formation fails, and the
potential for cross-regulation among Gata factors, was furtherinvestigated by evaluating the expression patterns of Gata4,
Gata5 and Gata6 in Gata4 morphant embryos (Fig. 5). Earlyendoderm development has been described in zebraﬁsh (Fieldet al., 2003; Wallace and Pack, 2003). By 28 hpf, a solidcolumn of cells called the intestinal rod has formed fromendoderm at the midline, with two thickened regions thatcorrespond to the future budding points for the liver (rostral onthe left) and pancreas (caudal on the right). At this stage (Fig.5, left panels), Gata4 transcript patterns are not signiﬁcantlyaltered by the MO, which is to be expected as the morpholinotargets translational arrest and not transcription. The gata5
gene is expressed at a low level in the developing intestine and
heart, and this is increased signiﬁcantly in the heart tube ofmorphant embryos. The pattern of Gata5 expression in the
Fig. 4. Gata4 deﬁcient embryos express early endoderm markers but

RT-PCR results for the early endoderm markers Sox17 and FoxA2.Assays used either 2 or 1 /H9262g of RNA, isolated for the RT reaction at
28 hpf or 48 hpf, as indicated. We consistently found no signiﬁcant
difference in the expression levels comparing control (WT) andmorphant (MO) embryos. (B) RT-PCR assays were also performedusing RNA isolated at 4 dpf for markers of differentiated intestine(I-fabp), liver (transferrin), and pancreas (elastaseB).(C-J) Representative embryos are shown following in situhybridization to detect transferrin RNA, comparing control (WT) andmorphant (MO) embryos at 2 dpf (C,D), 3 dpf (E,F), 4 dpf (G,H) and5 dpf (I,J). In all cases, the morphant embryos develop with a smallpatch of transferrin-positive cells (arrowheads in MO panels), butthis patch fails to grow when compared with controls (arrows in WT
panels). Views are dorsal, anterior to the left.

is enhanced in the morphant embryos (arrows in F), whereas at 48 hpf Gata4 transcript levels are clearly increased (D), but Gat a5 and Gata6
expression (H,L) is missing in the regions that normally show signal for pancreas (black arrowhead) and liver (white arrowhead) . Views are

intestinal rod appears relatively diffuse, when compared with
controls, suggesting that at these early stages endoderm ispresent in the morphant embryos but that the developing guttube is beginning to show some morphological disruption.Expression levels for Gata6 are not signiﬁcantly altered by the
Gata4-speciﬁc MO, either in the intestinal rod or in the hearttube. The analysis of Gata6 expression at 28 hpf showsconvincingly that, in both control (Fig. 5I) and morphant (Fig.5J) embryos, the intestinal rod has formed and has made initialbudding movements (and in addition that the heart tube hasformed and moved appropriately to the left). However,morphological defects are obvious by 2 dpf (Fig. 5, rightpanels), and are best seen in the expression patterns of Gata5and Gata6, which at this stage in control embryos clearly deﬁnethe budding liver, intestinal bulb and pancreas (Fig. 5G,K).Each of these patterns is either not apparent or severely reduced
in the morphant embryos (Fig. 5H,L). By this stage, transcriptlevels for Gata4 are increased appreciably when compared withcontrol embryos (Fig. 5C,D). Therefore, Gata4 negativelyregulates transcription of both its own gene and Gata5.
As shown above, Gata6 is an excellent marker for earlyendoderm and is also expressed in each of the gut-derived
organs, including the intestine, liver and pancreas. To evaluateendoderm development closely and rule out the possibility thatthe phenotype reﬂects a delay in organ formation, a reporterﬁsh line was generated that expresses GFP under the control
of the gata6 locus. These embryos recapitulate with GFP the
normal Gata6 expression pattern, and allow the continuedevaluation of the morphant phenotype in living embryos, asdevelopment proceeds (Fig. 6). The early activation of thereporter around 24 hpf is equivalent in control and morphantembryos (not shown), conﬁrming that activation of the gata6
gene is not dependent on Gata4, and that endoderm is speciﬁednormally. By 2 dpf, control embryos express GFP strongly inthe gut-derived organs, and the budding organ morphology ofthe intestine, liver and pancreas is easily visualized in thetransgenic animals (Fig. 6A). These organ structures grow
signiﬁcantly from 2 to 3 dpf (Fig. 6C). In the morphantembryos, a primordial tube is present at 2 dpf, and the initialstages of organ budding are visualized, including a slightlooping of the intestinal bulb to the left, and the initialemergence of the posterior (endocrine) pancreatic bud (Fig.
6B). However, between 2 and 3 dpf there is no furthergrowth of these organs in morphant embryos, and by 4 dpfGFP is difficult to detect, whereas control embryos displaybright green intestinal bulb, liver and pancreas.
Gata4 and Gata6 are redundant for liver budding,
but both are essential and non-redundant forsubsequent organ growth
The expression pattern and structural relatedness of Gata6
suggests the potential for functional redundancy with Gata4in both heart and gut formation. Recently, the function ofGata6 was evaluated in mouse embryos using the tetraploidcomplementation approach, in which the early requirementfor Gata6 in extra-embryonic endoderm is rescued. Micelacking Gata6 have apparently normal heart development,but show a liver defect that is very similar to the zebraﬁshGata4 morphants, with a failure in the expansion of the liverbud (Zhao et al., 2005). An effective morpholino forblocking Gata6 was described recently (Peterkin et al.,2003). Zebraﬁsh embryos blocked for Gata6 expressiondisplayed variable early heart defects, although endoderm-derived organ development was not evaluated. We testedthis morpholino sequence and conﬁrmed that it effectivelyblocks expression of GFP in the gata6:GFP transgenic
embryos for at least 5 days (data not shown), and alsoconﬁrmed the variable cardiac defects described byPeterkin et al. (Peterkin et al., 2003). For example, in thebackground of cmlc2 :GFP ﬁsh, the morpholino results in
GFP expression that is often either reduced, misplaced, orpresent in two non-fusing biﬁd primitive heart tubes (datanot shown).
At the highest morpholino concentration (5 ng), the
embryos blocked for Gata6 expression undergo adevelopmental arrest starting around the 14-somite stage,which precludes analysis of gut development. However,embryos injected with a slightly lower amount (2.5 ng) ofthe Gata6 morpholino continue to develop beyond the hearttube defect stage. These embryos (because they continue
embryonic development) presumably still express lowlevels of Gata6, although it is likely to be very low, as GFPDevelopment 132 (17) Research article

4011 Gata4 regulates formation of many organs Development and disease
expression from the gata6 :GFP transgene is not evident. These
embryos are markedly shorter than control embryos and
display the same heart tube defects described above. Whenanalyzed at 3 dpf, transferrin expression is variable, but it isalways reduced when compared with control embryos, and in
many cases it strongly resembles that of the Gata4 morphants(Fig. 7). Typically, transferrin expression marks a small liverbud, similar to that seen in the Gata4 morphants, except that itis sometimes misplaced to the right side, or else shows a morediffuse staining pattern in the region of the intestinal rod.Therefore, zebraﬁsh Gata6, similar to mouse Gata6 and tozebraﬁsh Gata4, is required for liver development. Using thesesame conditions, we next tested the effect of reducing bothGata4 and Gata6 by co-injection of morpholinos speciﬁc toeach gene. In this case the results are very clear, in that thereis a complete failure in the development of transferrin-positive
liver buds (Fig. 7D). To determine whether this block to liverdevelopment is caused by an early endoderm defect, embryosinjected with morpholinos targeting Gata4, Gata6, or bothgenes, were isolated at early stages and examined for theexpression of early endoderm markers by semi-quantitativeRT-PCR. At the shield stage, the Gata4, Gata6 and doublemorphants all express normal levels of the endoderm markersFoxA2 and Sox17, when compared with controls. Therefore,
the complete block to liver development caused by theinjection of both morpholinos cannot be explained by an earlyfailure in endoderm speciﬁcation.
Discussion
The function of Gata4 in heart development isconserved
The zebraﬁsh Gata5/ faust mutant displays a cardia biﬁd
phenotype, grossly similar to the Gata4 knockout mouse,
whereas the Gata5 mouse mutation does not have a cardiac
phenotype. Therefore, it has been considered that zebraﬁsh
Gata5 is the functional ortholog of mammalian Gata4 (Wallaceand Pack, 2003). However, we ﬁnd that the zebraﬁsh Gata4morphant shares a remarkably similar phenotype with Gata4null mouse embryos that are rescued, by tetraploidcomplementation, for the requirement of Gata4 in extra-embryonic endoderm (Watt et al., 2004). Both sets of embryosshow the same defect following normal heart tube formation,with the failure of the atrial (caudal) region to move rostrally,and the failure of chamber expansion. In both cases, the
myocardium is speciﬁed normally and cardiomyocytesdifferentiate, as indicated by the beating tube and theexpression of both early and later cardiomyocyte markers. Ourdata therefore indicate that Gata4 gene function is wellconserved across vertebrate species, and that its initial essentialrole in the heart is for a relatively late step of organmorphogenesis. Based on mouse models (Crispino et al., 2001;Tevosian et al., 2000; Watt et al., 2004), this function isprobably relevant to the epicardium, although conﬁrmation ofthis in the ﬁsh awaits the development of appropriate markers.Later cell-autonomous functions for Gata4 in the developingmyocardium are suggested by conditional null alleles in themouse (Pu et al., 2004; Zeisberg et al., 2005).
Gata4/Gata5/Gata6 regulates organogenesis from
the gut tube
An advantage of the zebraﬁsh model is that embryos can
survive a cardiomyopathy, which facilitates the analysis ofother phenotypes (Heicklen-Klein et al., 2005). In addition tothe heart, we ﬁnd that Gata4 is required for formation of theintestine, liver, pancreas and swim bladder. Gata4/Gata5/Gata6gene expression has been previously associated withendoderm-derived organs, and mouse knockout modelsshowed speciﬁc functions for Gata4 in the foregut (Kuo et al.,1997; Molkentin et al., 1997) and gastric (Jacobsen et al., 2002)epithelium, and for Gata6 in the visceral endoderm (Morriseyet al., 1998) and lung epithelium (Yang et al., 2002). Thezebraﬁsh gata5 gene is also essential for gut morphogenesis
and liver development, based on the analysis of the faust
mutant (Reiter et al., 1999; Reiter et al., 2001), and depletionof Gata6 in Xenopus or zebraﬁsh endoderm appears to disrupt
normal intestinal morphogenesis (Peterkin et al., 2003).Therefore, all three of these Gata genes have essentialnon-redundant functions in regulating organogenesis ordifferentiation of the gut. However, it is not entirely clear whichfunctions are conserved, and whether certain functions aremasked by redundancy, as the experiments have used variousmodel systems.
We ﬁnd that, in zebraﬁsh, Gata4 is required for both liver
Fig. 7. Gata4 and Gata6 have redundant functions for liver
development, but each gene is essential for liver bud growth.
Representative control embryos (A, WT), and embryos injected withthe morpholinos speciﬁc for Gata4 (B, G4 MO), Gata6 (C, G6 MO),or both (D, G4 +6 MO), are shown following in situ hybridization to
detect transcript for the liver differentiation marker transferrin. At 3dpf, the control embryos show a much enhanced liver growth(arrowhead) compared with either the Gata4 or Gata6 morphants(arrows). However, both morphants consistently show small liverbuds. By contrast, injection of both morpholinos results in embryosthat completely lack transferrin-positive liver tissue. Views aredorsal, anterior to the left.

and pancreas development. Gata4 was shown previously to be
involved in the establishment of albumin gene expression inmurine liver progenitor cells (Bossard and Zaret, 1998; Cirilloet al., 2002; Zaret, 1999), and to be capable of trans-activatingthe expression of the glucagon gene (Ritz-Laser et al., 2005).
The defects seen in the Gata4 morphant embryos do not appearto be related to speciﬁcation or differentiation. Initialmorphogenetic movements occur, including intestinal tubelooping to the left, and initial liver and pancreatic budding.However, failure of intestinal bulb, liver and pancreas growthis evident by 3-4 dpf, supported by the decreased levels ofdifferentiation markers. Previous work by Stainier andcolleagues demonstrated that vascularization is not required forliver development (Field et al., 2003). This, in addition to theapparently normal trunk vasculature, indicates that thephenotype is not secondary to a vasculature defect. It is
interesting that the endocrine pancreas initiates budding, as thespeciﬁc defect in exocrine pancrease development is consistentwith the observation that, in the mouse, Gata4 is expressed inthe murine exocrine (but not endocrine) pancreas (Ketola et al.,2004).
Most recently, a requirement for Gata6 in liver development
was documented in the mouse, by analyzing embryos rescuedfor the requirement of Gata6 in extra-embryonic endoderm bytetraploid embryo complementation (Zhao et al., 2005). Thesemutant embryos fail in liver bud expansion, although hepaticspeciﬁcation is intact and the cells of the ventral hepaticendoderm are capable of differentiation, based on RT-PCRanalysis for liver-speciﬁc markers. This phenotype isessentially identical to that of zebraﬁsh embryos blocked for
expression of Gata4. We cannot deﬁnitively rule out that the
small transferrin-positive liver buds arise in the Gata4morphant embryos as a result of leakage of the block, becausethe embryos are not genetically null. However, this seemsunlikely, because when analyzed for transferrin expression byin situ hybrdization, every morphant embryo develops the samesized small bud, over a range of morpholino concentrations thatappear to block completely Gata4:GFP expression. Zhao et al.suggest that the mouse Gata6 phenotype might result from afunctional redundancy of Gata4 and Gata6 at the earlier stageof hepatic speciﬁcation. Our data supports this hypothesis, asinjection of morpholinos that inhibit the expression of bothGata4 and Gata6 completely eliminates the liver bud andblocks liver-speciﬁc gene expression. Furthermore, we showthat the function of Gata6 in liver bud growth appears to beconserved with mouse, and that both Gata4 and Gata6 havesecondary non-redundant functions for liver bud growth. Sucha role for Gata4 in the mouse was considered unlikely (Zhaoet al., 2005), as Gata4 expression levels are reduced inhepatoblasts at this stage; however, our results suggest that thisshould be functionally investigated in the mouse.
Gata factors and early endoderm development
Early endoderm development appears to be normal in both the
Gata4 and Gata6 morphants, based on the expression of earlymarkers that are not speciﬁc to deﬁned organ systems. A recentstudy by Patient and colleagues (Afouda et al., 2005) supportsa more general role for Gata4/Gata5/Gata6 genes in thespeciﬁcation of early endoderm, in response to TGF /H9252signaling
during germ layer patterning. The speciﬁc defects that we
describe here were not noted by Afouda et al., when using amorpholino to target Xenopus Gata4. It is difficult to compare
the experiments, as the Xenopus genome encodes two distinct
Gata4 alleles (Jiang and Evans, 1996), which are difficult to
target with a single MO (A.H. and T.E., unpublished).
Therefore, Xenopus Gata4 might have been only partially
targeted, or Xenopus may be better compensated, with respect
to organogenesis, by Gata5 and/or Gata6 than zebraﬁsh. We
show that depletion of both Gata4 and Gata6 is not sufficientto eliminate the expression of early endoderm markers.Although our analysis was limited to a few genes, these havebeen considered to be reliable markers of endodermspeciﬁcation. Unlike the Gata4 or Gata6 morphants, loss ofGata5 in the faust embryo is sufficient to show a signiﬁcant
loss of early endoderm (Reiter et al., 2001). Therefore, if Gata4and/or Gata6 do regulate endoderm speciﬁcation, Gata5 islikely to compensate for their loss.
However, our analysis shows that Gata4 and Gata6 have
distinct essential functions in both heart and gut development.
The cardiac phenotype for each morphant is unique, and thedouble morphant indicates a lack of functional redundancy andan earlier morphogenetic function for Gata6 than for Gata4. Atthe highest doses of Gata6 morpholino, presumed to be themost similar to a null allele, there is a developmental arrest thatprecludes analysis of the gut endoderm, although it does notblock the expression of the early endoderm markers. At slightlylower doses, the embryos continue to grow and, although theliver fails to develop, the phenotype is similar but not identicalto that of the Gata4 morphant. Much like the heart phenotype,it is variable and the transferrin-expressing cells are oftenmisplaced from the normal site of liver budding. This is in
contrast to the Gata4 morphant. However, depletion of both
genes demonstrates a functional redundancy with respect to theearliest stages of liver budding and differentiation. In summary,there are likely to be overlapping (redundant) functions forGata4/Gata5/Gata6 during endoderm speciﬁcation, and bothredundant and non-overlapping (non-redundant) functions withrespect to speciﬁc organ systems at later stages. There is alsoan essential and redundant role for Gata factors duringmesendoderm speciﬁcation in C. elegans (Maduro et al., 2001;
Maduro and Rothman, 2002; Zhu et al., 1997). The fact thatGata4 functions in diverse organ systems, including the heart,liver and pancreas, may be related to the common embryonicorigins of heart and gut tubes from mesendoderm. With respectto the early Gata factor network, we ﬁnd that, in zebraﬁsh,Gata4 is not required for maintaining the expression of its owngene, or that of Gata5 or Gata6, but that it negatively regulatesboth itself and Gata5.
Novel functions for Gata4 revealed by the ﬁsh model
The swim bladder also fails to develop in the Gata4 morphant
embryo, and although this could be caused by a number ofdirect or indirect mechanisms (McCune and Carlson, 2004), inthis case it is probably related to a general failure of endoderm-derived organogenesis. In addition to its roles in heart and gutorganogenesis, our experiments reveal functions for Gata4 intail mesoderm and hematopoiesis. Gata4 morphant embryosdevelop with a kink at a speciﬁc position of the caudal tail.Although the signiﬁcance of this is not known, we note thatGata4 is expressed in the posterior tail bud mesoderm by the10-somite stage (Griffin et al., 2000; Heicklen-Klein and
Evans, 2004). The failure in blood development occurs aroundDevelopment 132 (17) Research article

3-4 days of development, coinciding with the anticipated
contribution of the deﬁnitive ‘adult’ stage of hematopoiesis,which replaces the transient ‘embryonic’ or yolk sac
population (Davidson and Zon, 2004). This might not have
been noticed in the Gata4 knockout mouse model, as the
mutant embryos die before the emergence of the deﬁnitivelineage. Because Gata4 is not known to be expressed inhematopoietic cells, it seems likely that the defect in deﬁnitive
erythropoiesis is secondary to the lack of an appropriate
inductive signal. An excellent candidate source is the liver,which fails to develop at this stage in the morphant embryos,and is a possible source of erythropoietin. Indeed, Gata4regulates the expression of the Epo gene in mouse hepatocytes(Dame et al., 2004). The availability of a zebraﬁsh loss-of-function model for Gata4 will facilitate further investigation of
these issues, and should stimulate additional efforts to
determine conserved functions in other model systems,including mammals.
